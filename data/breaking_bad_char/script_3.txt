TEASER
INT. TRIBAL POLICE CRUISER - DAY
CLOSE -- a SOUVENIR medallion hangs from a rearview MIRROR.
Sunlight glances off the small laminated rectangle, which
quivers slightly in the breeze from an open car window.
Printed in BOLD TYPE on one side: “HOMELAND SECURITY.” Just
as we’re wondering what this means...
... the medallion TWISTS in the wind, revealing its other
side. An old PHOTOGRAPH of an armed band of Apache warriors,
surrounded by more text: FIGHTING TERRORISM SINCE 1492
(actually, this is a famous 1886 photo of Geronimo & Co.)
An ironic commentary, you can’t walk into a tourist shop in
the Southwest without seeing a T-shirt or refrigerator magnet
bearing this image. As WE HEAR a POLICE RADIO SQUAWK:
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
KDK-12, come in... KDK-12...
OFFICER KEE, a young Native American deputy is at the wheel.
We realize this is a TRIBAL POLICE CAR -- the barren and
beautiful landscape of a New Mexico RESERVATION can be seen
outside his open WINDOW. He speaks into the mic:
OFFICER KEE
KDK-12.
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Hey, Bobby. Need you to look in on
Mrs. Peyketewa.
(Note: This is pronounced peck-a-TEE-wa.)
OFFICER KEE
Is she alright?
DISPATCHER (V.O.)
Her daughter called from
California. She hasn’t heard from
her in a while. Kinda worried.
OFFICER KEE
Will do.
EXT. NEW MEXICO DESERT - DAY
A line of TELEPHONE POLES snakes off across a barren valley.
SCRUB BRUSH quivers in HEAT LINES rising off the desert
floor. Then... a FAN-TAIL of DUST rises up on the horizon.
(CONTINUED)
It’s the TRIBAL POLICE CRUISER making its way along a dirt
RESERVATION ROAD. Slowing at an unmarked TURN-OFF. Does
anyone really live out here?
Then we see it. A small HOUSE, brown as the landscape that
surrounds it. A traditional outdoor adobe STOVE... a
satellite DISH... an n.d. GRAY CAR... seems a pretty typical
Reservation abode.
EXT./INT. MRS. PEYKETEWA’S HOUSE - DAY
The cruiser pulls to a stop near the car. The Deputy
emerges, makes his way toward the front door. He glances
about the place as his boots CRACKLE their way across the
gravel drive. Nothing seems particularly out of the ordinary
-- the place seems deserted, quiet.
The Deputy steps up to the front door, KNOCKS. Calls out:
OFFICER KEE
Mrs. Peyketewa? Hello?
No answer. The Deputy looks about, listens. KNOCKS again.
OFFICER KEE
Mrs. Peyketewa?
WEE-HO. The Deputy tries the door -- locked. Still not
overly concerned, he heads around the place, looking for...
... WINDOWS. He finds one -- probably a bedroom. Locked as
well. Can’t see much through the old-fashioned BLINDS. The
Deputy moves on to the back of the house. Coming upon... THE
KITCHEN WINDOW. Where he sees something... odd.
HIS POV - A STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE
Sits on a Formica TABLE. As if Mrs. Peyketewa just poured
herself a hot one. WE SCAN ABOUT, looking for the old woman.
There’s the percolator on the stove. A man’s SHIRT on a
drying RACK in a corner. But no sign of her. He TAPS on the
window.
OFFICER KEE
Mrs. Peyketewa?
Nothing but the WEE-HO. So he MOVES ON to the next WINDOW...
peering through the dusty glass into a small BREAKFAST NOOK.

(CONTINUED)
HIS POV - A SANTA MUERTE SHRINE
Set up on a small table against the far wall. On the
makeshift altar: a foot-tall, Day of the Dead-style female
SKELETON SCULPTURE draped in white LACE. Before La Nina
Blanca, money and various offerings. Items from victims?
It’s a mini-version of the creepy shrine we saw in 301,
replete with half-melted BLACK CANDLE and a sacrificial image
of HEISENBERG (a NEW drawing) scrawled on a bit of PAPER.
REVERSE - THE DEPUTY
Thinks this is a bit weird. To us, it’s goddamn scary. We
know the dreaded Cousins can’t be far behind.
The Deputy pulls his face back from the glass, continuing his
wary circuit around the house. As he does so, he just misses
what only we, in fact, see:
A FIGURE -- DARK and OUT-OF-FOCUS -- slips between us and the
unsuspecting Deputy. Blink and you’ll miss it.
Oh, that poor Deputy. We know something BAD is gonna happen
to him. As he rounds the far side of the house, making for
the next window through which to try and get a glimpse, he
hears something now. It turns his head, gives him pause.
It’s a BUZZING sound.... this is an insect-noise. Flies.
LOTS of flies. A sound anyone in the hinterlands knows means
one thing -- carrion.
His eyes fix on... a CLOUD OF INSECTS hovering near an old
BEATER on blocks in the backyard.
THE DEPUTY slowly approaches the wreck... EASES around it...
coming to a STOP at something that makes him CRINGE:
AN OLD INDIAN RUG
Rolled up, tossed haphazard in the weedy brush behind the
beater. It looks somehow... thicker than it should, bulging
with something more than just rug.
A PAIR OF LEGS. Elderly. Dressed in a single shoe.
Sticking out of the rolled-up rug at odd angles. Oh god...
It’s Old Mrs. Peyketewa! The gorge rising in his throat, the
Deputy instantly turns to face the house, simultaneously
drawing his SIDEARM. Scanning the immediate area with welltrained aplomb. Nothing in sight.
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 3
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Doesn’t mean shit. He remembers the hot cup of java.
Somebody’s close. Smart, scared, the Deputy HUFFS it back
the way he came, giving the house wide berth. He keeps his
pistol aimed dead at every window he passes. Ready to FIRE.
Making for his cruiser, he slips around to the driver’s door.
He holsters his pistol, reaches in to POP loose his 12-GAUGE.
Using his cruiser for cover -- CHIKKK-CHUK! -- he RACKS the
pump, pointing the shotgun at the front door of the house.
Stillness. Silence. But the Deputy’s not taking any
chances. He reaches inside the car... grabs the HANDSET...
OFFICER KEE
KDK-12 here... Janet, jesus, we got
a homicide...
DISPATCHER
Come again?
OFFICER KEE
Mrs. Peyketewa, she’s dead. I need
some backup out here --
DISPATCHER
Okay. On their way.
OFFICER KEE
Whoever’s in there -- show
yourself! Right now!
He drops the handset, leans out over the hood of the cruiser,
keeping aim on the house and its vicinity. Again, all seems
quiet. The Deputy in control of the situation. When...
CREAK. The front door slowly OPENS.
OFFICER KEE
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!!
We FOLLOW a SILHOUETTED FIGURE stepping out. We see the
Deputy in b.g., hunkered behind his cruiser, aiming at...
ONE OF THE COUSINS
Yes, those inscrutable grim-reapers from down south, here to
wreak vengeance on Walter White. Seems this is where they
decided to crash while they were waiting for the go-ahead.
This Cousin steps out into the sunlight. Barefoot, dress
pants and wife-beater T-shirt are his only attire. He
stands, stoic, staring at the cop with the shotgun as if he
were nothing more than a Girl Scout selling cookies.

(CONTINUED)
OFFICER KEE
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS... HANDS!
Though he never takes his cold gaze off the Deputy, the
Cousin obliges, ever-so-slowly, casually, RAISING his hands
face-high. Revealing... a shiny RED APPLE in his right fist.
THE DEPUTY keeps a bead on the Cousin, taking no chances.
OFFICER KEE
Alright, down. On your knees!
So focused on the perp in his sights... the Deputy fails to
notice MOVEMENT behind him. WE DO, though:
A FIGURE rises up from a hiding place in the near distance.
Though OUT-OF-FOCUS, it sure looks like THE OTHER COUSIN.
Also in wife-beater, he casually approaches the deputy,
carrying something SHINY over one shoulder. Oh god, it’s THE
FIRE AXE. The Cousins’ weapon of choice.
The Deputy is preoccupied with the first Cousin, who stands
statue-still before the open door, hands raised.
OFFICER KEE
You understand me?? Do you speak
English?? ¿Hablas Inglés?
No response. Just a cold dead stare, a ripe red apple, the
windmill WEE-HO, and the OTHER COUSIN approaching quietly,
relentlessly, like a dust-devil across the desert floor.
OFFICER KEE
I SAID DOWN, ON YOUR KNEES! DOWN!
¡DE RODILLAS! -- DAMN IT! GET
DOWN. ON YOUR KNEES! DO IT!
THE FIRST COUSIN begins to MOVE. Though not the way the
Deputy wanted. He slowly TURNS HIS BACK on...
THE DEPUTY, who TENSES, brandishing his SHOTGUN...
OFFICER KEE
ON YOUR KNEES OR I’LL FIRE!!
JUST AS the FIRST COUSIN brings the APPLE to his mouth... THE
OTHER COUSIN takes the axe HANDLE in both hands, raises the
BLADE HIGH over his head and...
--SKA...RUNCH!! THE FIRST COUSIN TAKES A JUICY BITE OF THE
APPLE... AT THE SAME INSTANT THE OTHER COUSIN BRINGS DOWN THE
AXE ON THE UNSUSPECTING DEPUTY!
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 5

(CONTINUED)
The Cousin enjoys his APPLE as -- mercifully OUT-OF-FOCUS in
background -- his counterpart BRINGS DOWN THE AXE AGAIN...
and AGAIN... chopping so much human firewood...

ACT ONE
THE SANDIA MOUNTAINS
At sunset. Towering red rock under an azure sky. WE PULL
BACK as WALT steps into view. We realize he’s looking at a
FRAMED PRINT hanging on a wall.
There’s something about this painting that intrigues him.
Jogs a memory. Maybe in us, too... but we’re hard-pressed to
recall where we saw this before. Truth is, this painting was
the backdrop for a scene -- the scene where it all began --
in the doctor's office where Walt learned he had cancer.
Maybe Walt’s mulling over everything that’s happened since...
or maybe he just likes paintings of the Sandia Mountains.
We’re not sure. He moves on now, making his way through...
INT. WELL-APPOINTED CONDO - DAY
Modern, open, this condo is tastefully furnished. It’s a
nice place in one of Albuquerque’s better neighborhoods -- in
other words, the anti-Beachcomber.
Just as we're wondering what Walt is doing there... RING. He
pulls his “regular” CELL from a pocket, checks the CALLER
I.D. with an unreadable expression, then answers:
WALT
Yeah.
SKYLER (V.O.)
I found the papers.
(a bit clipped)
Right where you left them, in the
crib.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
SKYLER sits at the counter, phone in one hand, DIVORCE PAPERS
spread out before her.
For Walt’s part, he’s more resigned than bitter (alright,
maybe a tad bitter).
WALT
Yeah, well, you know best, right?
Anything else?
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 7
(CONTINUED)
SKYLER
Do you have any thought about how
we’re going to approach this with
Walter, Jr?
WALT
He’s still my son. I mean, he will
remain --
SKYLER
-- Of course. My point being --
the divorce.
WALT
Well... I, uh, I think he gets it,
don’t you? I mean, I... I think he
saw it coming. He sees your
unhappiness, and...
SKYLER
(bitterly sarcastic)
“MY unhappiness.” My completely,
out-of-the-clear-blue-sky
unhappiness. Really?
WALT
(not wanting to engage)
Look, as you said. For the best.
Skyler checks her anger, regretting the conversation took
this turn. Regretting the rise Walt just got out of her.
SKYLER
Yeah, okay... um... Last thing,
and then I’ll let you go.
(re: papers)
Um in the Child Support
Worksheet... you list... medical,
dental, child care, transportation,
housing, education, food,
clothing...
WALT
That’s right. All of it.
SKYLER
Walt... no.
WALT
Skyler, you wanted me out, I’m out.
But I will provide for my family.

(CONTINUED)
SKYLER
Not with that money! You’d be
making us accessories after the
fact!
Walt’s eyes narrow. Pretty legalistic of her. He considers
a moment. Answers mildly, yet coldly.
WALT
Skyler, how do you think we’ve been
paying our bills these last six
months?
Not a complete surprise to Skyler -- still, she doesn’t quite
know what to say to that. Before she can answer...
... WALT notices someone enter the room behind him.
WALT
I have to go.
Walt summarily hangs up. Turns to greet a smiling REALTOR.
REALTOR
Yep, I was right -- three units
available, exact same floorplan. I
can call over, get you in to see
any of the others, if you’d like.
WALT
No, no this one’s fine.
(considers; nods)
I’ll take it.
The Realtor grins. That was easy! Except:
REALTOR
Now, unfortunately this one is the
model, so...
WALT
Yeah, I like it. I like...
(the Sandia painting)
Everything about it. I’ll-I’ll
take it as-is.
The Realtor grows a touch uncomfortable -- not wanting to say
no and lose a sale. Walt sees this and smiles politely.
WALT
Name one thing in this world that
is not negotiable.

Off the steel will of Heisenberg, faintly peeking through...
EXT. LOS POLLOS HERMANOS - DAY
To establish. A couple CARS dot the parking lot -- it’s midafternoon down-time (PRODUCTION NOTE: any fresh ESTABLISHING
SHOTS we can get while we’re here would be appreciated!)
INT. LOS POLLOS HERMANOS - GUS FRING
Businessman and secret meth kingpin, runs his MANAGER through
the paces of a new SODA DISPENSER (or some other appropriate
chicken joint machinery.)
GUS
So we try to clean them every
night. But make sure it’s off
before you open the intake valve...
Gus watches patiently as his employee gives it a try.
GUS
Good. Now, I suggest that you add
this to your Monday maintenance
schedule...
MANAGER
Yes, sir. Now select freezing
on... button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps... main
valve on, main switch on, give the
compressor time for the needle to
enter the green.
This all seems routine... until DING! A couple of fresh
customers enter through the restaurant’s glass door.
Gus doesn’t notice yet -- folks come and go all the time --
but we do. It’s the COUSINS, decked out in full regalia,
including their skull-toed BOOTS (We may even catch a glimpse
of the gray car they arrived in. It’s poor Mrs.
Peyketewa’s.)
The Cousins head for a far booth. They take their seats
BESIDE one another. Their gaze lingers our way a moment,
focused on Gus. Soon, though, they’re simply staring off
into space. Sitting motionless.
Gus gets this silent message loud and clear -- these two are
tired of waiting. They want Walter White. Now.
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 10
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
As Gus oversees his employee... he briefly glances back
behind him at the Cousins in b.g., who watch HIM. Keeping
the pressure on. Off this weirdly tense moment:
CLOSE ON - BLUE CRYSTAL
Light plays through the large, multi-faceted chunk -- it'd be
pretty if we didn't know this was Breaking Bad and that was a
crystal of meth...
When a GIANT HAPPY FACE looms into view. It's BADGER. WE'RE
LOOKING UP at him, as he admires the sparkling blue-ness.
BADGER
Yo, for real..? This is all you?
INT. JESSE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
JESSE, SKINNY PETE and Badger sit around a glass-topped
COFFEE TABLE set near the fireplace in Jesse’s spacious
LIVING ROOM. There’s not much else furniture-wise in the
room -- a dark SOFA, one CHAIR and a BOOM BOX plugged into a
far wall -- Jesse’s only worried about the essentials.
JESSE
(quiet pride)
All me.
Badger looks for confirmation. Skinny Pete grins and nods.
SKINNY PETE
“Heisenberg who?” That’s what I
say. My man Jesse can COOK!
(points to the crystal)
Check it, yo -- it ain’t cloudy or
dirty or nothing. Just the right
shade of blue...
BADGER
(nodding)
Good shade.
SKINNY PETE
Check out the crystal size, yo. If
that bitch was any bigger, it’d be
a Jolly Rancher!
Skinny holds up a fist to Jesse, who laughs and bumps
knuckles -- right on! Jesse nods, waves a hand at Badger.
JESSE
Be my guest.
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 11
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Oh indeed, Badger wants to. He fumbles in his pocket for a
Bic lighter, crushes the crystal into powder with the butt
end. However, lowering his head to take a snort, he pauses.
BADGER
You sure? I feel kinda dickish,
with you being in rehab and all.
JESSE
I can watch, yo. I can cook, and I
can watch.
SKINNY PETE
(off Badger’s look to him)
Go for it. I tried it like last
week -- I’m still coming down!
Alright, fuck it. Badger grins -- don’t gotta tell ME twice!
He drops his head out of frame and SNORTS a rail.
JESSE
Go easy.
When Badger raises his face back into view, it’s like his
hair’s on fire. In a good way. He’s practically trembling.
BADGER
WaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! --
(jumps to his feet)
Woo! Riverdance! Woo! RIVERDANCE!
Badger goes clomp-clomp-clomping across the broad, empty
living room, doing his best Michael Flatley. Skinny Pete
cracks up, shaking his head to himself.
JESSE
Hey, hey, hey stop marking on my
floor, dumbass. Come on.
BADGER
BOW BEFORE ME! I AM LORD OF THE
DANCE!! --
(stops jigging)
Shit, I gotta try that again.
Jesse interjects himself before Badger can get back to the
powder for another hit.
JESSE
Uh, yeah, no -- I think you’re
good.

BADGER
That is AWESOME, Jesse! I feel
like somebody took my BRAIN out and
boiled it in, like, boiling hot...
SKINNY PETE
(to Jesse)
It’s the bomb, man. Serious.
BADGER
... Like, like... anthrax!
Jesse really, truly smiles for maybe the first time this
season. He’s practically beaming. And why not? He’s proud.
JESSE
Good. So, um. You ready to talk
some business?
Badger and Skinny Pete share a wary look.
SKINNY PETE
You mean, this is not like just ...
recreational?
The boys share another look -- this is a touchy subject.
Combo’s death-on-the-job is on everyone’s mind.
JESSE
I know what you’re thinking. But
trust me, it’s not gonna be like it
was. Never gonna be like it was.
SKINNY PETE
How’s that?
JESSE
We sell it safe. Alright? We sell
it smart.
(then)
We don’t get greedy, like before.
Badger glances sidelong at Skinny Pete, gauging his reaction.
SKINNY PETE
I dunno, man. Combo and all.
Jesse nods, misses him too. He holds up a fist -- they all
bump knuckles in honor of their lost compadre.
A somber beat. Then Badger offers, cautiously:

BADGER
Still. Man’s gotta make his
living.
(off Skinny’s look)
If it’s like Jesse says and we’re
not greedy? I mean, I guess I can
see it.
Skinny Pete looks at him, considers. Yeah, okay. Maybe so.
SKINNY PETE
Had a good thing going ‘fore we
started pushing our luck.
BADGER
Yeah.
SKINNY PETE
If it can go back to being like
that and all...
He shrugs. Nods reluctantly -- I’m in. Jesse smiles, nods.
JESSE
Hey. It will be. Step One, we
build inventory. Badger, go see
Clovis. Get the RV in shape. Tune
up, oil change, brake lights and
whatnot. Cops always pull you over
brake lights. Not us. Cautious.
SKINNY PETE
Right on.
BADGER
You got it.
JESSE
Oh, and you know that buzzer thing?
(what?)
Leave the key in the ignition and
it buzzes?
BADGER
Yeah..?
JESSE
Whatever. Just have him put in one
of those, too.
Badger nods, though he doesn’t know what Jesse’s talking
about. We do -- the lack of a buzzer-thing got Walt and
Jesse stranded in Episode 209.

JESSE
Skinny. You’re in charge of

JESSE
Yeah?
BADGER
Yeah.
JESSE
Alright.
Jesse’s Posse, redux. Off this happy moment...
EXT. JESSE’S HOUSE - DAY (LATER)
WE’RE OUTSIDE... in someone’s LONG-LENS POV. Watching the
place from some distance up the road.
The front door OPENS. It’s Jesse, saying farewell to his
departing crew. Though we can’t hear what they’re saying
from this distance, they’re clearly JAZZED.
JESSE
So, uh, we’re good?
BADGER
Yeah.
JESSE
Good?
(off Pete)
Alright
SKINNY PETE
Let’s do this.
The trio stop to share an enthusiastic FIST BUMP, then Badger
and Skinny Pete head off down the walkway. As Jesse
disappears back into his house...
... REVEAL HANK. Hunkered down in his JEEP COMMANDER, his
eyes focused through small BINOCULARS. Drawls to himself:
HANK
Brandon Mayhew. I know you.

Small world, Albuquerque...

He lowers his binoculars, jots down license plates. Clearly,
wiretap or no, he’s ignored his boss about this case.
Off Hank, watching the house... knowing he’s onto something:

ACT TWO
CLOSE - A CLOCK RADIO
BIG BLUE NUMERALS glow (and probably STROBE, but we’ll deal
with it), filling frame. 5:59 AM changes to 6:00 and --
-- BZZZZZZZZ! A man’s hand reaches into frame, precisely and
neatly turning off the alarm. No sleepy fumbling.
(PRODUCTION NOTE: if we keep this frame very TIGHT, we could
shoot it most anywhere. The conceit is that it’s the bedroom
of Walt’s new place... but if we shoot it elsewhere, we don’t
risk banging up the upstairs of the Executive Producer’s new
condo. So thank you.)
INT. WELL-APPOINTED CONDO - MORNING - VARIOUS CUTS
CLOSE ON a PB&J SANDWICH being constructed. It’s done with
all the OCD care and neatness we’ve come to expect.
WIDE -- Walt stands alone in the kitchen of his new place,
dressed in Dockers and his undershirt. He cuts the crusts
off his sandwich, fastidiously bagging it in Ziplock.
CLOSE -- a dry-cleaning bag is pulled off a crisp OXFORD
SHIRT as it hangs from a curtain rod or somesuch. A couple
more CLOSE ANGLES of Walt putting on his shirt, buttoning it.
CLOSE -- the BROWN-BAG LUNCH Walt just made gets set down
atop the coffee table. How do we know it’s Walt’s? Because
Walt has neatly printed “WALT” on it in black Magic Marker.
WIDE -- Walt sits here in his wrinkle-free new shirt, poised
on the edge of the living room sofa, his bagged lunch before
him. He checks his watch. He’s nervous, anxious... but not
in a bad way. In fact, he can’t wait to begin work.
But he has to. It’s way early yet. So, Walt simply sits
here, staring into space. Willing time to pass.
It’s gotta be time now, right? He checks his watch again.
No, unfortunately. Off Walt, waiting in antsy yet motionless
silence... champing at the bit to get to his new LAB...
Waiting for his life to start having meaning again...
EXT. ALBUQUERQUE ROAD - MORNING
VROOOOM! The AZTEK zips along, or past. Finally, it’s time!
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 17
INT. WALT’S AZTEK - DRIVING - MORNING
Actually, judging by the fact WALTER, JR. is riding shotgun,
Walt is clearly doing his parental duty prior to work.
Junior glumly stares out the windshield. Dad glances at him,
keeps driving, glances once again.
WALT
You want to talk about it..?
WALTER, JR.
(a beat; finally)
Why? It’s not like I get a vote.
As excited for his new job as Walt is... as chipper as he’d
otherwise be right now... his son’s pain pains him.
Searching for something to say, something that will help:
WALT
You know... ironically, I think
you’re gonna see much more of me
from now on. For sure.
(off Junior’s snort)
Well, just as much of me, at least.
I’m taking you to school, to and
from, every day --
WALTER, JR.
-- What, I don’t get a vote with
that, either?! I gotta stop going
with Louis just because you’re
feeling guilty?
Ow. Silence. Eventually, Walt speaks again. Very quietly.
WALT
I do feel guilty.
(a beat)
I am the man that I am, son.
And... there is plenty that I would
change about that, but... here we
are, and this is just what it is.
He stares out the windshield, momentarily distant. Junior
sneaks a glance... then goes back to staring forward, too.
More silent driving. Walt looks to his son, manages a smile.
WALT
You know what? Call me crazy. But
I-I’m actually feeling very good
about the future.

(CONTINUED)
Junior would like to feel that way, too. Off father and son:
EXT. LOS POLLOS HERMANOS - MORNING
The LOT is fairly FULL, it’s a busy morning. As a familiar
VOLVO WAGON pulls into a far space, Gus emerging...
INT. LOS POLLOS HERMANOS - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
Gus enters, makes his way across the noisy room... hesitating
ever so slightly at the sight of two familiar BALD HEADS (we
see them from behind, out of focus in f.g.). Guess who.
REVEAL... THE COUSINS. Back again. Seated at their booth.
No food before them. Sitting arrow-straight, side-by-side
(like on the end of Walt’s bed in 302). They are not causing
problems, not making a scene. And yet...
There they sit, both facing the door, simply staring at Gus.
Lifeless stares -- like a shark’s.
Gus continues toward the counter, making a point to pass the
pair. His expression revealing almost none of the rage
behind his eyes. Almost none...
He continues on, heading behind the counter. Stepping up to
the Manager we met before. She speaks under her breath.
GUS
Ah... morning.
MANAGER
They’re ba-aack...
She’s just a touch nervous, but trying for light-hearted.
The cool look Gus gives her makes her smile fade a little.
MANAGER
I-I’m just wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.
GUS
Why? They’re doing nothing wrong.
And furthermore, I don’t wish to discuss it -- that’s the
polite and subtle message here, which the Manager receives.

at the Cousins, who stare at him from across the restaurant:
EXT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - MORNING
Its blinker flashing, the Aztek turns off the street and
motors up the driveway to...
... The corrugated steel building which houses the familiar
INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY. White steam rises from the roof.
Walt parks and climbs out, bagged lunch in hand. He stands
here a moment, breathes deeply. Taking the place in.
Here he goes, headed inside. First day on the new job!
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - MORNING
In what could well be shot as a ONER, Walt walks amongst
various EMPLOYEES, who go about their business cleaning tons
of LAUNDRY (we should use the folks who work at this place,
as they know how to use the equipment).
Remember, these are Gus’ folks -- they get paid to be deaf,
dumb and blind, as it were. Walt has a smile and a nod hello
for everyone. No one pays much attention to him. Whatever.
Walt reaches the machine that hides the entrance to his lab.
Without having to be asked, an employee operates the
hydraulics, swinging the huge machine up and away. Off Walt,
nodding thanks and stepping out of sight beneath it:
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
Walt steps into view onto the second-story CATWALK that looks
out onto our lab from above. And though he’s seen it before,
this place still gives him happy pause.
Even if you’re not a chemist, you can’t help but be wowed by
it all. It’s just so shiny... so high-tech... so right.
VOICE (O.S.)
Hello there! Uh, Mr. White, I
presume?
Walt looks down at a spot immediately beneath him -- notices
a man seated at a workbench below. The man gives him a wave.

WALT
Oh,yes, hi. I-I’m sorry, I’ll
uh... I’ll be right down.
Walt takes the spiral staircase, descending to the lab floor.
Where he meets...
GALE
Hi, Gale Boetticher.
They shake hands. GALE BOETTICHER (pronounced “BET-ick-er”),
is a thirty-something fellow with a smiling face that’s open
and gentle. In his dated jeans and denim shirt, he could be
a post-doc scholar or a folk singer. Turns out he's neither.
WALT
Hi. You’re my new lab assistant, I
take it.
GALE
Yes, I am. I suppose you’ll want
to hear my qualifications.
(reaching for papers)
I have my, uh resume here for you.
I received my bachelor’s degree
from UNM, my master’s from the
University of Colorado. Organic
chemistry with a specialty in...
it’s all right there.
He breezes through this stuff, not wanting to be a blowhard.
In fact, he’s a touch nervous -- but it’s not a nervousness
that stems from being unprepared. Indeed, this guy is aces.
WALT
(reads; impressed)
“X-ray crystallography...” Really?
Gale nods, smiles. In fact, his nervousness is borne of
respect. Walter White’s reputation precedes him.
WALT
I could talk about that for hours.
GALE
Ah, I would love to.
WALT
But first, I’m curious about
this...

He nods toward a contraption atop the workbench. Constructed
of a couple of flasks, a small pressure vessel and a few
lengths of polyethylene tubing, it looks a bit like Mini-Me’s
version of a meth lab. BROWN LIQUID simmers inside it.
Gale smiles, self-conscious.
GALE
Uhhh... that’s a-a little pet
project of mine. See, in my
opinion? It’s all about the quinic
acid level -- you want just north
of 4800 milligrams per liter. But
if you over-boil to get there,
you’re gonna leach your tannins,
your bitterness. Yech. So...
(taps pressure vessel)
... I pull a mild vacuum. That way
I can keep the temperature no
higher than ninety-two C...
(grabs Walt a mug)
... judge for yourself.
Gale turns a tiny TAP that looks like it should be releasing
liquid uranium or somesuch. In fact, fresh, piping-hot
coffee pours out. Gale hands Walt his steaming cup of joe.
Gale watches with anticipation as Walt takes a sip. Well?
WALT
(softly, to himself)
Oh my god.
(another sip)
My god. That is the best coffee
I’ve ever tasted.
GALE
Sumatran beans. And I also have to
give credit to the grind, but uh...
(deep, quiet pride)
Thank you, Mr. White.
Need we even say it? Need we spell it out? This guy is the
anti-Jesse. Walt smiles.
WALT
Walt. Please call me Walt.
(after another sip)
Why the hell are we making meth? --
Gale beams again. Wow. As he pours himself one, and Walt
raises his own mug in a toast -- Cheers! -- WE BEGIN:

METH-COOK MONTAGE - TO MUSIC
Unlike any cooking montage we’ve ever seen -- even the music
should be different. Maybe we’re talking CLASSICAL here...
or JAZZ... something complex, inspiring, uplifting...
Visually... slow-mo, elegant wipes, split-screen, 360 degree
stop-motion stills, fancy dissolves, time-lapse... this
should be a celebration of chemistry...
(NOTE: as we further define the Superlab process, the actoraction will expand, change, etc.)
-- Walt and Gale don Tyvek suits amidst a spirited
conversation...
-- Walt carefully prepares some chemical concoction. As he
reaches for a vial... he’s pleasantly surprised to find Gale
right there, handing it to him...
-- MORE SHOTS of the complex, high-end Thorium Process for
crystallizing meth... in balletic SLOW-MO, giving it a
lyrical beauty...
-- Walt works with a focused intensity... as Gale pat-dries
Walt’s FOREHEAD, like an attentive nurse...
-- Downtime, as our two cooks face off in an intense game of
CHESS (WEARING THEIR RESPIRATOR MASKS while they play?)
-- Poisonous-looking, dirty YELLOW SMOKE gets sucked up into
the air handling system overhead. Poof! Gone...
-- Up on the ROOF of the laundry, it comes out as filtered,
clean white STEAM...
-- Gale now works the machinery... Walt looking on,
admiration in his eyes... As the MUSIC ENDS...
INT. SUPERLAB - AFTERNOON - LATER
POP! A BOTTLE of red wine is uncorked. Nothing fancy,
necessarily -- it’s just a nice touch. Thought of by Gale,
of course, who’s the one popping it. He pours some into a
couple of disposable plastic cups, hands one to Walt.
Though still in their Tyvek suits, they’ve removed their
masks. It’s the end of their first day. A job well done.
WALT

GALE
Tell me, with the phenylacetic acid
solution, you said 150 drops per
minute for the first ten minutes,
and then ninety for the remainder.
Why is that?
Walt clearly enjoys such an eager pupil.
WALT
Well... my thinking is, by tapering
the phenyl you get a oilier aqueous
layer, and hence...
GALE
(getting it)
... better benzene extraction!
Walt nods, pleased. Gale offers a toast, they tap cups --
could this be any further from the Walt/Jesse partnership??
WALT
Exactly. But actually, I prefer
ether.
GALE
... I’ll-I’ll have it for tomorrow.
Damn he’s good. Walt considers the man.
WALT
Gale. I’m wondering. How you..?
Walt shrugs at this place. Gale picks up on his meaning.
GALE
... Ended up here?
WALT
Actually, I’m still wondering how I
ended up here, but... yes.
(nods; with a smile)
I mean, I can’t imagine we strike
each other as criminals.

No added toxins or adulterants.
Walt couldn’t have said it better. However, sensing Walt
wants more, Gale sips his wine, then continues.
GALE
Yeah, I was doing it the way you
are supposed to. Pursuing my
doctorate at Colorado. NSF
research grant. I was on my way.
Jumping through hoops -- kissing
the proper behinds... attending to
all the non-chemistry that one
finds oneself occupied by.
(then)
You know that world.
Walt does, indeed.
GALE
That is not what I signed on for.
I love the lab. Because it’s all
still magic, you know? Chemistry?
I mean, once you lose that...
WALT
(very quiet)
It is, it is magic. It still is.
Gale smiles faintly, seeing Walt is touched by the same
things he is.
GALE
And all the while, I kept about
that great old Whitman poem.
(Walt doesn’t follow)
“When I Heard the Learn’d
Astronomer.”
WALT
I don’t know it.

Ah. Anyway...

He looks to Walt -- sure you wanna hear it? Walt shrugs.
Gale snorts. What the hell?
GALE
When I heard the learn’d
astronomer;
When the proofs, the figures, were
ranged in columns before me;
When I was shown the charts and the
diagrams, to add, divide, and
measure them;
When I, sitting, heard the
astronomer, where he lectured with
much applause in the lecture-room,
How soon, unaccountable, I became
tired and sick;
Till rising and gliding out, I
wander’d off by myself,
In the mystical moist night-air,
and from time to time,
Look’d up in perfect silence at the
stars.
Gale is no thespian -- he doesn’t ham this up or otherwise
fill it with Shatnerian import. It’s just a simple
recitation of a poem that has meaning for him.
Walt nods appreciatively. Gale shrugs, self-conscious.
GALE
Yes, I am a nerd.
WALT
Bravo!

Thank you.
Walt just smiles faintly. He’s one, too.

INT. HANK’S JEEP COMMANDER - AFTERNOON
An empty FAST FOOD BAG (NOT Los Pollos), a folded NEWSPAPER,
BINOCULARS and such are spread across the passenger seat.
A Big Gulp-size drink is in the cup holder. Rising off all
this evidence of a man who lives in his car, we come upon...
... HANK. Head way back on the headrest, he’s fallen asleep
behind the wheel. After a BEAT... he SNORTS awake. Gets his
bearings. Finds the binoculars, taking a look at...
HIS POV - JESSE’S HOUSE
Jesse’s car is still there. No movement. Nothing to see.
HANK (V.O.)
Come on, Pinkman...
HANK continues scanning as he murmurs to his unseen prey.
Jesus, he’s looking bleary. Tired. A bit more STUBBLY, too.
HANK
C’mon, you little rat-bastard...
get off your lazy ass and go break
the law.
He sighs and sets down the binoculars, takes a tug off his
warm soda. Maybe rummages through an old food container for
left-overs. As he does so, eyes still on Jesse’s house...
... A froofy RING-TONE from his CELL. Not even looking, Hank
instantly recognizes the SOUND of it. Shit, not the greatest
time to be calling here, Marie. Still, he dutifully answers.
HANK
Hey, Baby.
MARIE (V.O.)
Are you ever coming home?
HANK

Marie stands in their kitchen, talking on the cordless.

Well, it’s not that simple, Baby.
There’s a little thing called The

She shakes her head, SO over it. On his end, Hank shakes his
head as well... but for a different reason. A beat of
exasperated silence, Hank watching the house, and then:
HANK
This kid? I swear to God -- I wish
I could just...
He sighs. Nope. Never mind.

don’t know where he keeps it. And
until he actually leads me to it --
or does something! -- I’m stuck
here, Marie. I’m sorry.
Marie stands there, glum. Feeling for her poor husband.
Considering. Something occurs to her now.

Pinkman? Now... YOU know that I

have, uh, dealt you a little weed.
Walt is really listening now. Like, bionically.
WALT
Hank...
HANK
Just a little. And I SO do not
care about that. As far as I’m
concerned, you never inhaled, okay?
Like you said, cut to the chase.
Do you remember if this Pinkman kid
ever had an RV?

You know, a-a recreational vehicle.
You know, like a-a Winnebago-type
deal? Brown and beige?
It takes a moment for Walt to recall how to breathe.
WALT
Uh... why?
HANK
Well, it’s a long story, but I’m
personally of the opinion that he’s
moved on from weed and has
graduated to selling crystal meth.
Using it as a rolling lab.

nothing but the yellow pad and a CALCULATOR before him. He’s

He taps the calculator... writes a result. Seems pleased
with his projections, when... RING! It’s his DROP CELL.
Jesse picks it up, squints at the CALLER READOUT before
answering (we DON’T need an insert for this). He recognizes
the incoming number immediately. Mr. White is calling?!

Frowning dyspeptically, Jesse’s curiosity nonetheless gets
the better of him and he answers. Unfriendly and casual:

Yo.

A SQUEAL of tires catches Badger’s attention. He looks as...

anything important or particularly incriminating is getting
left behind (most lab stuff is BOXED or TARPED, by the way).

It’s an abbreviated moment, to be sure, as the heat is on.
But after all, this RV holds a lot of meaning for Walt (and
for us, as well). Bad days and good days were spent here.
Lotta water under the bridge, as they say.
The place is amateur-hour compared to Walt’s new superlab.
Still... there’s a whole lotta memories in this hunk of junk.
Suddenly... BANG! The RV door flies open (or maybe Old Joe
never fully closed it). JESSE barges in, pissed.
JESSE
The hell you think you’re DOING?!
Huh?! --
Taken by surprise, Walt is about to give it right back to
Jesse -- when something DAWNS.
WALT
Me?
Fear grows in Walt’s eyes. Jesse notices, is maybe a touch
confused, but hey, he’s on a roll and --
JESSE
This is mine just as much as yours!
You don’t get to just -- just --

WALT
Oh God. Oh God.
JESSE
What?
Before he finishes, Walt has already rushed past him to the
BACK WINDOW. Peering through the shade, his eyes widen as
his worst fears come true.
WALT’S POV -- glimpsed through the curtain, HANK’S COMMANDER
is rounding into view into the yard (currently as far away as
possible while still achieving the proper audience
identification and impact). Oh, yeah -- it’s headed our way!
WALT, of course, PANICS. He RUSHES around, slamming and
locking the DOOR, shutting CURTAINS, closing the DRAPES that
separate the cab. Jesse watches him, confused.
JESSE
What?
WALT
He’s here.
JESSE
Who’s here? --
Jesse peeks out the back window himself. Yeah, there’s that
same exact Ohhh FUCK!-look now. He turns to Walt, wide-eyed.
Walt is so dry-mouthed with fear that he’s not even angry.
WALT
Oh, God. You led him right to us.
As it comes crushing down on Jesse how much shit they’re in:
EXT. CRUSHER YARD - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS
The Commander slows to a stop, idling. We can see the rear
end of the RV REFLECTED in the WINDSHIELD... and through it,
we see Hank behind the wheel, staring out.
WIDE. We, in turn, now reveal that Hank has parked his truck
directly behind the RV, BLOCKING IT IN very nicely. (Jesse’s
red Toyota is parked here somewhere nearby, by the way.)
Like Ahab, Hank gazes out at his white whale, savoring this
moment. Victory. It’s been a long time coming.

ACT FOUR
EXT. CRUSHER YARD - AFTERNOON - SECONDS LATER
We start HIGH OVER Hank’s COMMANDER. As high as we can get.
Looking down as Hank climbs out of his truck. Leaves the
driver’s door open for cover as he stands here appraising the
situation.
Hank is going on forty-eight hours without sleep. Mentally
and physically exhausted as he is, however, he’s still a good
cop. He knows Jesse is no match for him -- unless Jesse has
a gun, or maybe a few friends around.
Therefore, Hank takes this cautiously (though perhaps not
cautiously enough, as this is a “call for backup” situation,
and not one he should take on alone). Still, he’s not
arrogant. He’s careful, patient.
Which only makes it worse for our two boys inside the RV.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. RV - AFTERNOON - OUR BOYS
Are silently shitting bricks. Piano-wire tense, not wanting
to even breathe, Walt and Jesse stand their ground inside
this darkened interior, sharing fearful looks.
Not much point looking out the window, is there? They know
Hank is out there. Regardless, Walt wouldn’t risk cracking a
shade for a quick peek out, as Hank might SEE HIM. As it
stands, right now Hank doesn’t know Walt is here -- only
Jesse. Walt may as well postpone the awful inevitable.
Jesse winces -- oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.
Outside, Hank stands holding position behind his open truck
door (reminiscent of how he stood talking to Tuco at the end
of 202). No answer from inside the RV. Big surprise, right?
Hank shoots a glance around behind him. The rest of this
junkyard is quiet. No others in sight.
Ready to proceed, Hank draws his GLOCK. CLOSE ON the back of
his waistband as he subtly transfers it out of his paddle
holster and into the side POCKET of his bomber jacket.
Now, keeping his right hand tucked inside his jacket pocket
and his left hand free, he can have his pistol always in
hand, yet completely out of sight. The dude is smooth.
Keeping his eyes on the prize, Hank cautiously walks to the
RV. Nothing happening down the driver’s side.
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 41
(CONTINUED)
Hank takes a careful peek into a corner of the RV’s REAR
WINDOW -- but can’t see inside due to the thick curtain. He
rounds the passenger’s side, keeping eyes on every window he
passes.
For Walt and Jesse, Hank is like the shark in “Jaws,”
circling their little boat. Their DOOR suddenly JIGGLES.
Walt and Jesse FREEZE -- hoping, praying it holds.
Walt reaches out a hand, silently GRIPPING the inside door
handle. Subtly PULLING tight. Willing it to stay closed.
RATTLE-RATTLE, RATTLE... locked and secure. Whew. Walt’s
hand remains in place, though.
Walt and Jesse share an anxious look, when... BANG-BANG-BANG!
Hank POUNDS on the door. AHH! JESUS! He then knocks on a
WINDOW right by Jesse, who JUMPS, startled. As Jesse opens
his mouth, about to blurt out some expletive at Walt --
-- Walt MIME-SHUSHES him with a look of wide-eyed terror.
Don’t give away that I’m HERE, stupid!!
HANK (O.S.)
Jesse Pinkman? You wanna add
“resisting arrest,” we’ll add it.
No skin off my ass...
(more rattle-rattle; then)
Last chance to do it the easy way.
Now... SILENCE. Which only increases their anxiety. Is that
the faint sound of Hank’s FOOTSTEPS trudging away from us?
Where’s he going? They strain to hear. Jesse ventures a
tiny peek out the nearest window.
Outside, Hank has briefly stepped away to find a length of
STEEL PIPE or somesuch. Something for breaking down RV
DOORS. An object suitable to this task should likely be at
hand -- this is a junkyard, after all.
Seeing what’s coming, Jesse ducks from the curtain before --
KA-BOOOM! -- something HITS the door from outside, creaking
the RV and scaring the PISS out of Walt, Jesse and us.
We continue this INTERCUT between Hank working to BEAT DOWN
the RV DOOR and Jesse and Walt cringing just on the other
side of it. ONE HIT... TWO HITS... it won’t be long now.
Our two guys are truly, utterly, in every glorious sense of
the word, fucked.
BOOOOM! One more hit might do it. JUST as he’s about to
stave in the RV DOOR, Hank is paused by...

(CONTINUED)
OLD JOE (O.S.)
Got a warrant? --
Hank turns to find... OLD JOE standing behind him, arms
folded, a few yards off.
Old Joe is clearly no physical threat to Hank, nor would he
try to be (that’d be a good way to get arrested and/or shot).
Instead, he just stands back, watching with sour disdain.
Inside the RV, Walt and Jesse listen with bated breath. Hank
considers Joe warily.
HANK
Who are you, huh? Who are you and
what do you know about this RV?
OLD JOE
I’m the owner of this lot, which
means you’re trespassing on private
property. As far as the RV goes,
seems to me that it’s locked --
which means you’re trying to break
and enter. So I say again... you
got a warrant?
HANK
Well, I don’t need one if I’ve got
probable cause, counselor.
It doesn’t blow Old Joe’s hair back. This dude has been
around the block. Hank doesn’t intimidate him.
OLD JOE
“Probable cause” usually relates to
vehicles, is my understanding. You
know, traffic stops and what-not.
HANK
(indicates the RV)
See these round, rubber things?
Those are wheels. This is a
vehicle.
OLD JOE
(indicates the RV)
This -- is a domicile, a residence.
And thus protected by the Fourth
Amendment from unlawful search and
seizure.

HANK
Look Buddy, why don’t you just go
out --
OLD JOE
-- Did you see us drive in here?
How do you know it runs? Did you
ctually witness any wrongdoing?
(before Hank can answer)
Seems to me you’re just out here
fishing.
(shrugs; mildly)
Don’t see that holding up in a
court of law.
In the RV, Walt and Jesse listen intently, daring to hope.
Hank snorts. Goddamned jailhouse lawyer.
HANK
Oh, yeah? Look at these.
Remember the FIVE BULLET HOLES in our RV door? The ones
which have been here ever since the Pilot episode? Four of
them are still covered by weathered strips of DUCT TAPE. The
fifth strip dangles just a little, showing a GLIMPSE of HOLE.
Hank tugs at the tape, showing the BULLET HOLE to Joe. Hank
pulls another strip loose, and another, revealing more HOLES.
HANK
What do those look like to you?
On the other side of the door, thin SHAFTS of LIGHT appear
one by one, beaming through the darkness and the dust motes
and landing hot on WALT’S FACE.
HANK
They sure look like bullet holes to
me. Here’s a firearm discharged
inside this “domicile.” I’m
willing to bet there’s a judge or
two out there who’d see that as
probable cause. But I tell you
what, why don’t you call the
Albuquerque police --
Old Joe considers, deadpan yet momentarily stymied.
Off the silence, Walt figuratively steps into the breach.
He bends close to Jesse, his lips practically brushing
Jesse’s ear. Whispering so as not to be heard outside:
BREAKING BAD #306 "Sunset" SCRIPT AS BROADCAST 44

(CONTINUED)
WALT
“How could you have known that they
were there before you took off the
tape?”
JESSE
(panicked whisper)
What?
WALT
“How could you have known that they
were THERE before you took off the
tape?” Say it! Say it!
Jesse shakes his head, not wanting to -- but Walt SHOVES him.
Do it!! Jesse swallows hard, calls out LOUDLY:
JESSE
HOW COULD YOU HAVE KNOWN THEY WERE
THERE BEFORE YOU TOOK OFF THE
TAPE?!
Outside, Hank raises an eyebrow -- how’s that? Old Joe nods
and picks up this thread.
OLD JOE
That’s right. Probable cause needs
to be readily apparent.
(drawls; covering)
Huh. There’s somebody in there.
Walt whispers again to Jesse:
WALT
“I’m in my own private domicile and
I won’t be harassed!”
HANK
-- I’ll give you three seconds to
get your ass out here. One, two...
JESSE
THIS IS MY OWN PRIVATE DOMICILE AND
I WILL NOT BE HARASSED! BITCH!
Walt gives Jesse a look -- idiot!
Hank stares up at the RV, ready to rip Jesse a new one the
moment he gets his hands on him. And yet...
... Take a deep breath, count to ten. Rethink, regroup...

Hank turns back to Old Joe, considers him. Hank shakes his
head half-admiringly, half-contemptuously. The hint of a
crooked smile plays across his face.
HANK
Fine. You want your warrant? I’ll
have my guys bring it and deliver
it to you on a little satin pillow.
How’s that?
(then)
I waited this long, I can wait a
little longer.
Hank wanders back to his Jeep Commander, casually leaning
against it -- placing himself where he can keep an eye on the
RV’s one and only DOOR. He pulls out his cell and dials.
HANK
(into phone)
Hey Vicky, yeah... Schrader. Get
me Merkert, willya?
Inside the RV, Jesse looks to Walt. We bought ourselves some
time... but it ain’t over yet. NOW what?
INT. RV - AFTERNOON - LATER
Walt hasn’t moved. He sits staring at the floor. Is he
despairing? Giving up? Jesse seems to think so -- he paces,
all nervous energy, shooting Walt the occasional glance.
JESSE
I say -- I say we just ram him,
alright? We, uh we, we start her
up, just ram the shit out of his
truck... and make our escape!
Right?!
Walt raises his eyes, staring flatly at Jesse... who groans,
giving in and rejecting the idea. (BOTH their voices need to
stay LOW and WHISPERED throughout this scene, of course!)
JESSE
Yeah, he’d, uh... he’d shoot me in
the head. Yeah, he’d shoot me in
the head.
(then; desperate)
So what do we DO, man?! Huh?!
What do we... what..?
(small and scared)
Please tell me you got something.

Walt actually does. He’s been mulling it for a few minutes
now, and it just might work. However, it’s such a horrible
method... so hateful and evil... that he’s been sitting here
debating with himself.
But finally, there’s no other choice. And so, as if with a
dark shroud of self-loathing hanging about him:
WALT
Yeah. I got something.
Jesse’s all ears -- anything that gets them out of here is
good news to him. What? What is it, man?!
Wearily, reluctantly, Walt pulls his cell phone from his
pocket. With a heavy glance to Jesse, he hits speed-dial.
WALT
(into phone)
It’s me. We need your help.
EXT. CRUSHER YARD - AFTERNOON - MINUTES LATER
Right where we left him, Hank leans against his truck,
staring at the RV. Warrants and backup should be here soon.
Then Hank will be a hero again, instead of a career-damaged
agent who turned down the biggest promotion of his life.
Old Joe has disappeared, by the way. A beat of silence, then
Hank’s cell RINGS. He pulls it from his pocket and answers.
HANK
Yeah.
FEMALE VOICE
Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?
Hank frowns -- weird. Who’s using my full name?
HANK
Yeah. Who’s this?
FEMALE VOICE
Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner
with the Albuquerque Police. Is
your wife Marie Schrader?
Hank’s heart suddenly lurches into his throat. There’s only
one kind of call this could be.
HANK
Yes. Why?

FEMALE VOICE
I’m sorry to inform you that your
wife’s been in an automobile

HANK
How is she..? What’s her
condition?
FEMALE VOICE
I don’t, um, have the most current
information, Sir, but I think
you... might want to get there as
soon as possible.
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. SAUL GOODMAN’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS
Saul sits behind his desk. Looking surprisingly... subdued.
Seems even Saul finds this despicable. As we REVEAL...
... FRANCESCA, Saul’s secretary, standing by. She is talking
on a cheap DROP CELL. She’s “Officer Tanner,” apparently.
Saul only hears her side of the call, but it’s enough.
Click. He hangs up, breathing fast. Back in Saul’s office,
Francesca takes the phone away from her ear, stares at it a
short moment before handing it over. So this was Walt’s
plan. Francesca, speaking quietly, feeling very bad herself:
FRANCESCA
You’re gonna have to start paying
me more.
Uncomfortable Saul has a hard time looking her in the eye.
He gets it, doesn’t argue. Off him, taking the DROP CELL in
both hands and BREAKING it backward, DESTROYING the evidence:
RESUME - HANK
Who’s forgotten what he's doing or why he's here -- only one
thing matters now -- Marie. He jumps behind the wheel, kicks
his truck into reverse. As he FAN-TAILS it out of here, his
Jeep receding in the distance and passing out of sight...
... A beat of motionless silence. Then, CREAK... the RV’s
damaged DOOR gingerly forces open.

Walt climbs out, moving like he’s aged fifty years in the
last hour. Jesse, descending into view behind him, looks the
same.
Walt’s added burden, however, is the stinging GUILT he feels
for what he’s had to do to his poor brother-in-law. This
guilt presses down like an anvil on his shoulders.
Here comes Old Joe in the distance, making his way out of his
office toward them. Off Jesse, studying Walt... and Walt,
silently staring off into the distance after Hank...
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL ER - AFTERNOON - BOOM!!
HANK BURSTS through the emergency room DOORS of an ABQ
hospital. This is the Admitting area -- to enter the actual
Trauma Center, you must be escorted past a SECURITY GUARD.
Hank is frantic, brushing past several STAFFERS, finding an
ADMITTING NURSE working a mouse behind her STATION.
Hank asks her about Marie, frantically. We don’t hear any of
the dialogue, just the panic in Hank’s head.
The Nurse -- used to this kind of emotion -- checks her
patient log. Hank’s got no time for that shit, however (he’s
not being a bully or anything, it’s just that he’s scared).
He’s starting to make a scene. The nurse tries to defuse.
Hank opens his mouth, about to show her “calm.” But before
things can turn truly ugly --
-- A familiar, FROOFY RINGTONE cuts through the fear and
static in Hank’s brain. Maybe it’s been ringing for a few
seconds already. Maybe WE noticed it before Hank did.
Recognizing it, Hank blinks, bewildered -- then fumbles in
his jacket, pulling out his ringing CELL and answering it.
HANK
(hoping against hope)
... M-Marie?
MARIE (O.S.)
(typically breezy)
I’m just checking in. I’d love to
have some idea of whether I should
cook dinner or not.

Hank stands here, relief flooding through him. And hot on
the heels of it, a realization dawns -- he’s been HAD.
Off the adrenalin practically leaking out of him now, making
him light-headed... and a profound bitterness and anger
sweeping in to take its place...
WIDE on Hank, a tiny figure in this hallway, his phone to his
ear, staring at the floor. A sad, defeated tableau.
INT. RV - AFTERNOON
Just as we left it, only Jesse and Walt are noticeably GONE.
It's strangely quiet, except for the distant GRIND of some
kind of machinery. This GRIND is growing LOUDER.
When suddenly... CRASH!! Two huge, shiny steel FORKS come
lancing in through the side! They cause a shower of BROKEN
GLASS as labware and equipment get violently kicked around.
The pierced wall STAVES INWARD, hit from the outside by some
large o.s. FORCE (a diesel wheel-loader). Off the inside of
our mobile lab, which seems to be IMPLODING...
EXT. CRUSHER YARD - AFTERNOON
SUNSET, if possible. To the painful sounds of BUCKLING STEEL
and SHATTERING GLASS... we see our poor old RV is meeting its
demise in a massive CAR CRUSHER. Old Joe works the CONTROLS,
reducing our iconic meth lab to a load of scrap.
In reality, this complicated process takes a bit of time.
Therefore, we will play this in MONTAGE with lots of ANGLES,
which will allow us to shorten the process editorially.
Walt and Jesse stand watching it happen. They should really
get the hell out of here... and they will, momentarily... but
this is a hard sight to ignore. It’s sad and melancholy.
Goodbye old friend. Off Walt and Jesse, staring...

We TILT DOWN from (hopefully) a glorious SUNSET filled with
fat red and orange clouds. We find ourselves in the middle
of nowhere. A familiar Volvo wagon is parked off to one side
of the frame. A gray n.d. sedan is parked on the other.
Between them, Gus stands facing the two Cousins. Apparently,
this is what Gus meant by “sunset” -- a clandestine MEET.
Is Gus taking a big risk, alone out here with these homicidal
lunatics? If he’s nervous, he doesn’t show it. He is quiet
and in control, as always. He speaks SPANISH, SUBTITLED.
GUS
I told you before. You will not
kill Walter White. Not until my
business with him has concluded.
One of the Cousins responds quietly, also in Spanish. He
doesn’t glare or grimace or otherwise threaten -- really, he
doesn’t need to. These dudes are scary without even trying.
FIRST COUSIN
We’ve waited long enough. We won’t
wait any longer.
GUS
You’ll have to. The decision isn’t
yours to make.
This doesn’t go over well with these two. In fact, the body
language all around feels a little like an Old West showdown.
But before it can turn into the OK Corral...
GUS
Explain to me -- why this man
White? He betrayed your cousin
Tuco, yes... but he’s not the one
who murdered him.
