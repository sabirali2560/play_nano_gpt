TEASER
EXT. BLUE SKY
Harsh sunlight. It FLARES in our lens. We hear SOUNDS of a
struggle OFF-SCREEN. The FIGURE OF A MAN darts in and out of
frame, close to us... quick and out-of-focus... and
upsidedown?
It’s a few moments before we realize this man is... someone
we know. Yes, it’s famous ‘70s action figure: G.I. JOE!
WIDE TO REVEAL:
EXT. MEXICAN HACIENDA - BACKYARD - DAY
Two young, similar looking BROTHERS (age 9) are at odds over
the plastic toy. One boy, MARCO, climbs high on a swing set,
dangling the G.I. Joe out of brother LEONEL’S reach. Leonel
is angry and crying... he wants his toy back, but Marco is a
bully and is having too much fun being bad. They yell at
each other in Spanish (without subtitles).
YOUNG LEONEL
Give it back! It’s mine!
YOUNG MARCO
Then take it from me. If you can!
The yard they fight in is a nice piece of property -- not
that the owner is super-wealthy, but he has money. With an
O.S. telephone RING RING -- we are about to meet this man...
... but only the back of his head. We are behind an ADULT
MAN, relaxing on a chair in the shade of his hacienda. He
watches the kids roughhousing in the distance. The man dips
his hand in a GALVANIZED WASH TUB filled with melting ice and
beer, trying to stay cool.
RING RING! Our weary mystery man finally reaches and answers
his cell phone... but not just any cell phone. It’s one of
those monstrous BRICK-SIZED mobiles from the mid-eighties
(our first clue that this scene is a FLASHBACK).
As we slowly CIRCLE AROUND toward his face, he speaks in
Spanish (with SUBTITLES).
MYSTERY MAN
Mmm. Yes...
(listens; then)
Why? Why is this still under
discussion? No. No, no, no. I
don’t like him.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
I don’t care who he knows. We’re
supposed to trust him with our
product?
(derisive)
Big man. Big Generalissimo! Big
fry cook is more like it... The
‘Chicken Man.’
It interests us to hear this is likely a discussion about our
“Chicken Man,” Gus Fring. But what’s even more surprising is
that this man doing the talking is...
TIO! Yes, Uncle Tio SPEAKS! He’s about twenty years
younger, without his wheelchair, oxygen tube and ever-present
bell. So, if this is Tio, that means the young boys fighting
over on the swing set are most likely...
THE COUSINS. Our cousins. Before they’ve grown into
homicidal maniacs. Before they’ve left a fiery swath of
death and destruction in their wake.
But now... they’re just little kids fighting over a toy.
Frustrated Leonel makes a leap for G.I. Joe, but Marco flings
the doll to the ground and jumps on it -- CRUNCH!
Leonel looks on, stunned, as Marco holds up G.I Joe’s SEVERED
HEAD with a smile. He broke it... for no good reason, he
broke it! Leonel turns and runs crying toward his uncle.
Tio is just finishing his call:
TIO
You will do what you want. But you
have my vote. Never trust a South
American. Dirty, dirty people.
Tio hangs up the phone, frustrated with whatever bullshit
political haggling he has to deal with. He doesn’t
acknowledge the tearful boy waiting for an audience with him.
But finally...
The stare is too much. Glancing out of the corner of his
eye, he sighs, addressing the kid...
YOUNG LEONEL
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!
TIO
He was just having fun. You’ll get
over it.
YOUNG LEONEL
No! I hate him! I wish he was
dead!

MYSTERY MAN (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
Wow. This kid is pissed. But Tio barely reacts. He
considers the statement. Rolls it around in his brain
without emotion. Tio looks out at Marco...
... who is chucking pieces of doll out toward the horizon.
With a sharp WHISTLE, Tio gets Marco’s attention. He motions
for the boy to come over, which he dutifully does. Leonel
stares daggers at him, waiting for punishment to be served.
But Tio’s mind seems to be somewhere else. He gestures to
the washbasin at his side, now filled mostly with water from
the melted ice.
TIO
Marco...
YOUNG MARCO
Yes?
TIO
Grab your old uncle a beer, would
you?
Marco kneels down and picks a bottle floating near the top,
but he’s quickly interrupted --
TIO
No, no. A cold one.
Marco realizes -- oh, okay. For a moment, he sees his own
reflection in the water surface. As the boy reaches down
into the depths of the tub, Tio suddenly and viciously grabs
him by the back of the neck, and...
SPLOOSH! Shoves the child’s head UNDERWATER! We see from
INSIDE THE TUB LOOKING UP as the wide-eyed boy is submerged.
Leonel looks on, stunned... freaked. Tio gives him a casual
glance, not easing up on Marco at all.
TIO
This is what you wanted. Your
brother dead. Right?
Watching his brother drown, not knowing what to do, Leonel
pulls on his uncle’s arm. Locked in place, it won’t budge.
The kid might as well be shaking an oak tree. With mock
concern, Tio advises...
TIO
You’re going to have to try harder
than that. If you want to save
him.
BREAKING BAD #307 "One Minute" AS BROADCAST 3.

(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
How much longer do you think he has
down there? One minute? Maybe
more, maybe less.
Desperate to save his brother, Leonel hauls off and PUNCHES
Tio in the shoulder. No effect. Leonel hits him again and
again, in the shoulder, in the chest, until in desperation...
BAM! Square in the face, hard! Tio’s head snaps backwards.
Blood trickles from his nose. And with that... Tio smiles.
SPLOOSH -- he releases Marco, who comes out of the water
gasping and sputtering for breath. Leonel kneels next to
him, making sure his brother is okay.
Tio stands up (yes, he walks too!), towering over the crying
boys. His lesson for them? Delivering it with a conviction
they’ll never forget...
TIO
Family is all.
And as this Guardian-of-the-Year candidate walks away, we
FOCUS on the brothers’ faces. Their stares are dead, but the
message sinks in. Family is all.
CUT TO:
EXTREME CLOSE-UP on a MATCH BEING LIT. The flame is brought
to a black candle, beneath a familiar Santa Muerte SHRINE.
The drawing of Walter “Heisenberg” White still attached. We
are...
INT. N.D. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)
The surroundings are too dark to tell where we are, as we
REVEAL the (adult) COUSINS, kneeling in positions similar to
how we left them as boys... but now on a mission. A mission
to avenge the death of their blood cousin, Tuco Salamanca.
Family is all.
But their vengeance, once aimed at Walter White, has a new
target... as one cousin removes the drawing of Heisenberg and
fastens something new to the death shrine...
A PHOTO OF HANK (a telephoto shot, perhaps taken by Mike and
given to them by Gus).
Off Hank’s picture, flickering in the candlelight...

ACT ONE
EXT. JESSE’S HOUSE - DAY
Quiet. Birds CHIRP in this pretty part of town. It’s late
in the day and the light is fading.
Jesse’s Toyota putters to a stop in front, MUSIC pumping from
the stereo. Jesse parks and drops his head back, letting the
music play. He’s fucking exhausted... relieved, after what
happened just an hour or so ago (the events of 306). After
he was trapped in the RV with Walt, and was almost caught by
DEA Agent Hank Schrader... Christ, it was close.
But it’s over... for now. He lost his RV, but that’s for
another day to figure out. Now it’s time to unwind.
Jesse shuts off the car and climbs out. As he trudges to his
front door, we hear the O.S. SOUND of a truck RUMBLING to a
stop in the street. Jesse glances to see...
It’s Hank. Okay, it’s not over. Hank gets out of his Jeep
Commander and makes a steady beeline for Jesse. Hank’s been
awake for two days now, running on fumes... the pain of being
told his wife Marie was “dying in the hospital” fresh in his
mind. The humiliation of being tricked by a punk like
Pinkman leaving a putrid taste in his mouth.
Jesse holds up his hands, nervous, not wanting trouble... and
yet with the slightest hint of a smirk on his face after
getting over on Hank.
JESSE
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.
Alright? You can call my lawyer.
Saul Goodman.
But Hank doesn’t stop. He keeps coming at an even pace.
Scary calm. Jesse’s a little unnerved, but stays strong.
JESSE
Talk to my lawyer, alright? Hey,
you hear me? I got nuthin’ to say.
(Hank keeps coming)
I told you. You can call my --
But when Hank is near enough, still in stride while walking,
he rears his fist back and...
BAM! - unleashes a hellish roundhouse square into Jesse’s
face! The impact sends Jesse hurtling backwards into...
BREAKING BAD #307 "One Minute" AS BROADCAST 5.
INT. JESSE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
... sliding across the wooden floor (amid whatever crap was
established there in 306 before Jesse left).
JESSE
Uuuuhh... Christ!
Jesse is stunned, recovering from the brutal sting with
enough time to look up and see...
Hank is still coming. One punch was not enough. Hank keeps
attacking, straddling Jesse as he tries to back away. BAM!
HANK
You had my cell phne number? You
had my wife’s name?!
The punches get even more intense. Jesse is defenseless as
blow after blow finds its mark.
HANK
How’d you do it? Talk! Who’re you
working with?!
But Hank doesn’t give him a chance to answer. He’s lost
control. The torrent of punches will kill Jesse, until...
Hank’s eyes zero in to focus. He soon realizes, the kid is
out cold.
Breathing hard, Hank sees the blood, the limp body below
him... oh fuck. What did he do? Hank knew going in that he
was crossing a line, he just didn’t know how far he’d go. He
sees he completely obliterated the line.
Hank backs away... a flight instinct creeping in. The open
door is right there. He can just walk out and drive away.
Hank’s going to leave... but before he crosses that
threshold, Hank stops... catches his breath...
Off Hank, his eyes on the motionless Jesse...
TIME CUT TO:
EXT. JESSE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
The rear door SLAMS on an ambulance as EMTs have loaded Jesse
inside (we don’t see what the damage is to Jesse just yet,
but suffice it to say, it’s pretty damn bad). The emergency
vehicle drives away, red lights flashing.
BREAKING BAD #307 "One Minute" AS BROADCAST 6.
(CONTINUED)
We find Hank sitting alone... sad and stoic in the face of
this grim reality. The pain from his bruised hand just
starting to creep in. He looks over to Jesse’s front door,
where...
His boss, ASAC MERKERT, speaks to two ABQ PATROL OFFICERS.
Hushed tones, incomprehensible mumbles to our ears. But
they’re clearly recounting the events as the evidence seems
to spell out. The ASAC gives them a nod and moves away,
making his way toward Hank...
Hank sees his boss coming, and stands respectfully... but
there’s a sort of glaze over Hank’s face. Lost. Beaten.
The ASAC takes a breath, feeling bad for Hank. He isn’t
angry or conspiratorial. His tone is straight-forward and
supportive, wanting to make the situation as painless as
possible.
ASAC
(meaning the cops)
If you’re, ah... ready to talk,
they want to get a statement. Your
side of what happened here. Or we
can hold them off ‘til another
time.
But Hank still doesn’t respond, searching for the right
words... until the ASAC provides:
ASAC
Maybe you want to talk to a lawyer.
Hank hears the advice. Swallows and manages a nod.
Off subdued Hank, the idea of a lawyer front-and-center in
his mind...
INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE’S ROOM - NIGHT
ANGLE ON A CEILING. An odd sight, but even odder as...
SAUL GOODMAN’S head slides sideways INTO FRAME, looking right
at us. Examining, the lawyer raises a CELL PHONE and snaps a
photo... FLASH! He looks at his screen: oh yeah.
SAUL
There it is.
Saul proudly turns the camera screen toward us, revealing a
PICTURE OF JESSE’S BRUISED FACE.
BREAKING BAD #307 "One Minute" AS BROADCAST 7.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
SAUL
Yo, Adrian. Rocky called -- he
wants his face back.
We REVEAL Jesse in his hospital bed, as horrible as the
picture showed, and feeling a hundred times worse. Hank
really did a job on him. He can barely move his jaw, and his
left eye is SWOLLEN SHUT from a broken eye socket, his face
BRUISED and DISTENDED from a broken cheek bone.
Jesse winces -- it hurts all over. He wants to say “fuck
off,” but it pains him too much to talk. Reactions slightly
woozy from a concussion -- his head feels half-full of thick
fluid.
SAUL
Come on, I gotta cheer you up.
(re: photo)
You see that? That’s your “GetOutta-Jail FREE” card.
Jesse’s good eye follows Saul as he circles around to the
other side of the bed. Saul couldn’t feel more on top of the
world...
SAUL
You understand “Get Out of Jail
Free” card, right? I mean, just
blink once if you’re following...
(moving on)
The DEA’s worst nightmare is that
face out in public. They’re gonna
have to steer a wide berth of young
Master Pinkman. For fear of the
P.R. poop-storm that will rain down
on them if this story ever gets
out.
(happy)
I mean, this-this beating? Best
thing for you. You’re home free.
Good, right?
(beat)
Right.
As Saul tries to get a response out of mute Jesse...
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - SAME
A minimum amount of activity in the hall as WALT appears,
peeking around a corner. Secretive, nervous... he’s taking a
HUGE risk coming here. He moves cautiously, waiting for the
coast to be clear. Not drawing attention, eyeing the I.D.
numbers that mark each patient’s door.

(CONTINUED)
Finding the right room, Walt turns his back on the door.
Glancing left and right... no one is looking... he carefully
slips into...
INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
But all of Walt’s concern for himself slips away when his
eyes fall on Jesse. Walt is stunned. Never believing that
Hank could be capable of such violence. Softly...
WALT
Oh my God...
Jesse’s good eye rolls at the sight of Walt -- the last
person he wants to see right now. Saul, to Walt:
SAUL
You’re now officially the ‘cute
one’ of the group. Paul, meet
Ringo. Ringo... Paul.
WALT
This is... I... Jesse, I-I am...
so sorry for this. This should not
have happened.
JESSE
But it did. No thanks to you...
Jesse stews as he eyes Walt. The apology not nearly enough
for the pain he’s endured. Walt tries to move past now...
WALT
(rationalizes)
But the plan did work. We would’ve
be locked up right now if we didn’t
lured him away. But this... this,
I-I just never saw this coming.
So...
(unsure; to Saul)
What, uh... What happens now?
But before the lawyer can answer, Jesse speaks through his
tight jaw.
JESSE
What happens now? I’ll tell you
what happens now. Your scumbag
brother-in-law is finished. Done.
You understand? I will own him
when this is over.
BREAKING BAD #307 "One Minute" AS BROADCAST 9.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Jesse’s focused anger shocks Walt... shocks us. He’s not
yelling, but there’s a quiet vitriol that makes us understand
he won’t rest until Hank is humiliated and destroyed.
JESSE
Every cent he earns, every cent his
wife earns, is mine. Any place he
goes, anywhere he turns, I’m gonna
be there, grabbing my share. He’ll
be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana for
pennies, and I’ll be standing over
him to get my cut. He’ll see me
when he wakes up in the morning,
and when he crawls to sleep in
whatever rat hole’s left for him
after I shred his house down. I
will haunt his crusty ass forever,
until the day he sticks a gun up
his mouth and pulls the trigger
just to get me out of his head.
That’s what happens next.
Walt is speechless. This is the new Jesse. A Frankenstein
monster of Walt’s own creation.
Saul tries to calm the situation. To Jesse:
SAUL
Uh, my advice? That’s probably not
a good strategy. I mean, they’re
scared of you right now. They want
nothing to do with you. But if you
hit them, they’re forced to hit
back -- hard. I mean, they will
turn over every rock hither,
thither and yon until someone
spills the beans on you and-and
anyone associated with you.
Present company included.
Jesse hears this, and there’s a subtle reaction... something
clicking in his head. Meanwhile, Walt gently chimes in.
WALT
Yes. I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense. Jesse, move
on with your life.
(meaning crime)
Leave it behind. All of it.
Jesse, having heard enough, finally responds.

(CONTINUED)
JESSE
Nothing changes once I walk outta
here. I get myself a new RV and go
start cooking again.
Whoa. WHAT?! Walt and Saul look at each other.
WALT
How exactly do you think you’re
going to get away with that? They
will catch you.
JESSE
So what?
WALT
What?
JESSE
I have a “Get-Outta-Jail Free”
card.
SAUL
Hey, I may have overstated the, uh
power of your face.
JESSE
Not this. If the cops catch me, I
give them what they want most.
(points to Walt)
You.
Walt blanches, right in Jesse’s cross-hairs...
JESSE
They nab me, I make a deal to give
up the great “Heisenberg” and his
million-dollar drug ring.
(confident)
You’re my free pass, bitch.
Off Walt, now the target of Jesse’s boiling anger, his
scorched earth aggression...
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Walt and Saul exit the room, walking... but something holds
Saul back. Walt knows what it is. Walt looks around...
motions him into someplace private.
Walt shrugs to his lawyer, trying to comprehend what just
happened in there.

(CONTINUED)
SAUL
You’re so sure.
WALT
Look, if he didn’t give up my name
while Hank was beating him
senseless, he’s never going to
talk.
Saul is dead serious. It’s his ass on the line, as well.
SAUL
What do you think that was in
there? A bluff? He wants your
brother-in-law. And there’s gonna
be a parade of lawyers creaming
their Underoos for a case like
that. I mean, I’d take it myself
if it wouldn’t cause so much
collateral damage.
(even more serious)
And him cooking again? Hey, when --
not if -- he gets caught, and he’s
facing twenty years... what’ll he
do then? Believe me, there’s no
honor among thieves.
(then)
Except for us, of course.
Walt is stymied. Saul is right. Jesse is absolutely going
to fuck them over.
WALT
(not fully believing)
No, he’ll... He’ll come around.
SAUL
(considers)
If he doesn’t... there may come a
time to talk options.
Said matter-of-factly... and yet this is darkly ominous.
WALT
Options.
Saul nods. He exits, leaving Walt to wonder... exactly what
options? Since Saul has pitched jailhouse murder before, it
seems horribly clear what he means.

ACT TWO
INT. DEA ABQ - CONFERENCE ROOM - EARLY MORNING
WIDE in a conference room at DEA Headquarters. Hank, his
UNION REP (a big burly retired officer, there to act as
Hank’s counsel) and his ASAC are at the table with two ABQ
POLICE DETECTIVES. Again, not confrontational -- they’re
just gathering facts. And Hank calmly gives them...
HANK
... convinced that Mr. Pinkman was
involved in the manufacturing and
distribution of phenyl-2
methamphetamine, specifically what
we’re calling the “blue meth,” I
tracked him to a scrap yard, where
he stored an early ‘80s camper...
an RV. While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle, which I
believed to be a rolling meth
lab... I received a phone call.
Telling me my wife, Marie, had been
injured in an accident.
Hank tells the story with no emotion, no embellishment...
remaining professional.
HANK
Upon hearing the news, I left Mr.
Pinkman and his vehicle to attend
to my wife. After arriving at the
hospital, I learned the emergency
call was a hoax. My wife,
fortunately, was unharmed...
Hank clears his throat and pushes on, past the embarrassment
of being duped...
HANK
So, I immediately went back to the
salvage yard, but the RV was gone.
Most likely destroyed on site.
ABQ DETECTIVE #1
And it was at this point that you
drove to the home of Jesse Pinkman.
Hank is about to nod and continue his story, but his Union
Rep leans over and whispers in his ear. He hears the advice,
letting his rep talk to the detectives now...
BREAKING BAD #307 "One Minute" AS BROADCAST 13.
(CONTINUED)
UNION REP
I think we’re done here. Agent
Schrader needs to get home, get
some rest.
ABQ DETECTIVE #1
That’s fine. But just to
confirm... you’re taking the Fifth
here.
Not a huge deal -- they just want to make sure. Hank gives a
glance to his Union Rep.
HANK
Yeah, that’s correct.
ABQ DETECTIVE #2
Okay. Well, we just want to give
you all a heads up... Mr. Pinkman
is pressing charges in this matter.
He’s given a detailed version of
events. As he sees them.
UNION REP
The word of a meth head?
ABQ DETECTIVE #1
We know all about his history.
We’re well aware, but...
(regretful)
Toxicology on Pinkman... his blood
is clean. He’s not using.
ABQ DETECTIVE #2
Kid is even refusing his doctorordered pain meds, far as we can
tell.
This is surprising as hell to Hank, though he barely shows
it. Hank exhales, ready to get out of there.
HANK
So, um. Where do we go from here?
ASAC
Couple of gentlemen from OPR will
come down, probably tomorrow
morning. Janice will get us an
exact time on that.
(to detectives)
And you men will be continuing your
investigation. So... thanks for
your time.

(CONTINUED)
Rising to leave, there’s one more piece of business.
ABQ DETECTIVE #1
Right, we just... we need one more
thing. A photo of Agent Schrader’s
hands. For the record.
Hank pauses. If we didn’t notice before, there’s a BANDAGE
around his right hand (treated by medics at the scene).
HANK
Yes. Of course...
ABQ DETECTIVE #1
Bandage off, if you would.
Hank peels off the gauze wrapping, revealing the DARK
BRUISING beneath. Where his knuckles met Jesse’s face.
Detective #2 produces a small DIGITAL CAMERA. Hank holds out
his hands, not sure what to do with them.
ABQ DETECTIVE #2
Ummm... on the table is fine. Flat
on the table is fine.
Hank sets both hands down, on this table that’s a little low,
below normal reach. Just to make this humiliating act even
more awkward, as he bends down to lay his hands flat.
The detective aims his camera, and -- FLASH!
INT. DEA ABQ - HANK’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
Hank gathers his bag for the trip home. He absently collects
a few papers, not even sure what he’s grabbing. The time
alone in here is a relief, and he’s drawing it out.
But, it’s time to go. He steels himself, and exits out to...
INT. DEA ABQ - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS
Hank moves through the bullpen... a long walk of shame. Hank
shows nothing, says nothing, holds his head high... but the
agents early for work give him subtle glances -- the end of
Hank Schrader? How the mighty have fallen. What a shame.
Hank hangs tough, never making eye contact through the
gallery of faces, all the way down to the ELEVATORS.
He pushes the call button. Hank’s home free, until -- DING --
the elevator doors open to REVEAL...

MARIE. She meets her husband’s eyes, full of worry and
concern. Hank almost cracks, but eases onto the elevator.
The doors slide closed.
INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
Alone, in the privacy of the elevator, Hank hugs Marie. In
fact, he holds onto her for dear life, as if the elevator
were in free fall. Tearful, the most emotion we’ve ever seen
from Hank.
Marie embraces her man, no words spoken. Just a comforting
hand against his back.
INT. DEA ABQ - LOBBY - EARLY MORNING
DING! The elevator doors open, and Hank is composed as if
nothing emotional had just happened. Marie hides it less
well than Hank, but she pulls it together.
MARIE
It’s all gonna work out. You’ve
been too good to them for too many
years.
As they make their way toward the building exit, Hank speaks
low, for only his wife to hear...
HANK
I hope it goes without saying...
(meaningfully)
We’re not talking to anybody about
this. Okay?
They keep walking, as...
MARIE
...o-okay.
There’s just enough of a pause and meekness in Marie’s voice
to stop Hank in his tracks. His head lowers in quiet defeat.
HANK
Marie... who?
Off of Marie’s guilty face...

EXT. WALT’S CONDO - MORNING
SKYLER rolls into frame (the obvious recipient of Marie’s
news). She parks her WAGONEER outside of Walt’s new home
(which he bought in 306).
Skyler turns off the car engine and readies herself. She
dreads having to see him...
INT. WALT’S CONDO - MORNING
CLOSE UP -- A KNIFE, coming into frame, pressing down along
the crust of a sandwich. It’s the end of Walt’s morning
ritual, as he fixes his lunch for the day.
A sandwich wrapper and brown bag are nearby as Walt cuts the
PBJ sandwich. Methodical. Hypnotic. Making it OCD perfect.
Until... BZZZZZZZ.
Walt looks... the doorbell? His first visitor. He wipes his
hands on a towel, taking it with him as he beelines to the
front door. Opening to reveal...
Skyler. Surprised, off-guard... their first contact since he
hung up the phone on her (in #306).
WALT
Hi.
SKYLER
Do you have a minute?
WALT
Sure.
Walt gives way to allow Skyler inside.
Skyler enters, and surveys the inside of Walt’s new condo.
Nice in here. Impressive. But Skyler can’t help herself:
SKYLER
I guess crime does pay.
Any little bit of happiness Walt may have had upon seeing
Skyler fades out like a dying light bulb. But he remains
polite, neatly folding the dish towel in his hand.
WALT
I don’t suppose you just came by to
insult me.
Skyler takes her focus off the living space and looks at
Walt.

SKYLER
No. We need to talk.
(then)
You heard about Hank. About what
happened with this, um, Jesse
Pinkman.
Walt, so far beyond lying anymore, nods.
WALT
Yes. I know.
Walt crosses back to the kitchen area, wanting to hang up his
towel.
SKYLER
Whatever Hank was investigating...
Him trying to find an RV. Is there
any danger that could lead back to
you?
This question catches Walt (and us) a little off-guard. Is
Skyler showing concern for Walt’s safety? Walt doesn’t think
too much about it... she might just be nosy.
WALT
No. Why would it?
Not exactly a lie... but stretching the truth.
WALT
Is that why you’re here?
SKYLER
I’m here to talk about Hank. You
know what’s gonna happen to him if
this Pinkman presses charges.
(off his look)
Hank could lose everything.
Walt nods, somber. He agrees. And so?
SKYLER
I thought maybe, um... there’s a
way you could help him.
WALT
How?
SKYLER
Contact Pinkman. Get him to drop
these charges.
Walt considers her a moment. Choosing his words carefully...

WALT
Look, Skyler, I don’t know what
kind of relationship you picture me
having with this person --
SKYLER
-- I’m not asking.
WALT
-- He was, he’s-he’s not my friend.
I mean, it’s not as if we were ever
close.
SKYLER
I’m not asking. But there must be
something you can say. Isn’t it
even worth a try? Hank is your
family.
WALT
Not currently.
Ouch. Skyler lets this sink in -- did she hear him right?
SKYLER
What?
WALT
I said “not currently.”
Wow. Cold. Skyler examines Walt, and he moves back to the
front door, opening it for her to leave.
WALT
I’m late. I have to go.
He waits, clearly wanting her to exit before he leaves.
Walt’s a bit of a dick here, but this is exactly what she
wanted -- to have him out of her life. Skyler sees it --
whatever emotional connection there was between them is
completely gone. Stunned, she heads out...
Skyler eases outside... she might turn around, she might not,
but Walt closes the door on her, not waiting long enough to
find out.
Walt keeps a hand on the doorknob, the “options” over what to
do with Jesse rolling around somewhere in his mind. Skyler’s
request... Saul’s words... Jesse’s threats...
Somewhere in Walt’s brain there’s an answer...

INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
Walt enters, deep in thought. An answer in there somewhere.
GALE (O.S.)
(happy)
Hello!
Walt looks to see his new assistant, GALE, paging through the
New York Times. Gale brightens at the sight of Walt.
GALE
Starting to get worried.
WALT
Car trouble.
GALE
Oh, that’s a bummer. Y’should call
me next time, I’ll pick you up.
Walt moves to set down his lunch bag and belongings, as Gale
shadows him (without crowding him). Gale, we may discern, is
dressed less casually this episode. In fact... he’s dressed
a bit like Walt.
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and Walt subtly
notices.
WALT
No, uh... sandals today..?
Gale smiles, a touch self-conscious.
GALE
I just thought... bit more
professional.
(then, upbeat)
Well. Everything is on track --
we’ve got our distillate. Just
waiting to...
Walt gives a polite smile. Uh-huh. Walt moves to the “Clean
Zone” area where they change their clothes (and a locker if
we have it), and where the Tyvek suits are located.
WALT
Let’s get our trays ready... clean,
no moisture.
GALE
Done.

WALT
(testing him now)
Is our, uh... our solvent filtered?
GALE
(proud)
I thought you might ask that.
Done.
Walt nods -- Gale is the perfect assistant. A bit absently:
WALT
That’s good. That’s good.
GALE
Hand-in-glove -- that’s what we
strive for.
(Bogart-lite)
You know, this might be the
beginning of a beautiful
friendship.
Gale gets a good feeling over his “Casablanca” comment... but
Walt pauses to consider the remark. Something isn’t sitting
right. As if a foul odor is wafting under his nose...
EXT. EMPTY LOT - DAY
The middle of nowhere. A paved over piece of land where
someone maybe once considered putting a WalMart but then
abandoned the idea. A lone TRACTOR TRAILER sits on the
tarmac -- a big thirty-foot delivery rig. Inside:
A little Willie Nelson-looking TRUCKER relaxes behind the
wheel -- bored, waiting... drinking coffee from his thermos.
He checks his watch as...
A GREY CAR comes cruising across the blacktop at a casual
pace. The trucker exhales -- about fucking time. He climbs
out of his rig to greet...
THE COUSINS. They park and step out. Scanning the scene to
make sure no one else is around. Just the trucker.
TRUCKER
So. You the gentlemen?
The cousins nod. Yes, they are.

INT. TRACTOR TRAILER BED - MOMENTS LATER
The rear doors CREAK open, and the trucker climbs inside,
followed by both cousins.
TRUCKER
Lucky you boys caught me. I got a
load to pick up, I’m takin’ the
Forty straight through to Memphis.
The trucker (talking non-stop) leads the cousins down the
large expanse of empty trailer. The roof has sections of
opaque white Plexi, allowing light into the deep area.
TRUCKER
I can hammer it out in about
fifteen, but there’s this gal
there. Named Lainie or Lolly or
something... Maybe Fran. Anyhow,
she’s got one of these fetish
things where she likes to get peed
on? You know. So, I was hoping to
see her tonight, but she’s real
strict about wanting to go to sleep
before ten. So I want to wrap it
up here A.S.A.P. ‘cause traffic can
be a wild card. You know,
rubbernecking and such.
(afterthought)
The surprising thing is... the
women who like to get peed on
always tend to be from the warmer
climates. You’d think the ones in
the colder zones would be more
inclined, but... I haven’t met one
yet. Maybe it’s a shock to the
system if the body’s not properly
acclimated. But, y’know... leave
that for smarter minds than me.
Science is a mystery.
When the trucker reaches the far end of the empty truck, he
pulls out a little RATCHET from his pocket. Slips it into a
tiny hole in the wall and cranks... CLICK. He opens...
A FALSE WALL. He swings two doors open to reveal...
A WALL OF WEAPONS, all neatly displayed -- assault rifles,
Uzis, an array of pistols, plus more exotic weapons like
samurai swords, throwing stars and other military
knickknacks.

TRUCKER
Well, take a gander. Prices are
negotiable, buying in bulk gets you
a discount. Running a special on
these little honeys...
The trucker holds up a bullet for the cousins to see. An ECU
shows us that this particular .45 caliber bullet is BLACK.
TRUCKER
JHPs. Hollow point bullets known
by the natives as the “Black
Death.” Check it out...
He hands it to one of the cousins (Leonel)...
TRUCKER
You like that? So sweet you wanna
lick it. Nickle-plated brass
casing. Lubalox coat for panache.
Sucker has six razor claws that
expand on impact. PTT-KYUUUuuu.
Shred your mama’s head like a
cabbage.
The cousin isn’t really interested. He hands it back toward
the trucker, who refuses.
TRUCKER
Keep it. On the house.
We take note as Leonel slips the bullet in his FRONT
POCKET... to use for later.
TRUCKER
Anyhow... I’ve been windjammin’
long enough. Why don’t you boys
tell me what you’re looking for?
What is it you want, what is it you
need? What can I do ya for?
Finally, Leonel answers him... in English...
LEONEL
Vests.
TRUCKER
Vests? Hell yeah, we got vests!
Right here...
The trucker pulls two BULLETPROOF VESTS out of a duffel bag,
offering them out to each cousin.

Sleek, comfortable. Thermally

just ain’t getting through. And
lightweight? Damn. So lightweight
you’ll forget you’re wearing it.
That’s all well and good, but the cousins look at him...
MARCO
They work?
TRUCKER
Sure as shit they do. I don’t
leave home without it!
The trucker pulls down his shirt collar, revealing...
He WEARS a BULLETPROOF VEST beneath. Big smile.
The cousins look at each other, a moment of understanding.
Then... LEONEL PULLS HIS GUN, aiming it square at the
trucker! Holy shit!
BLA-BLAM!!! The GUN BLAST knocks the trucker to the floor!
He recoils, holding his ribs in pain.
TRUCKER
Errrewewew-unnnnnnnnnn! WHAT THE
HELL!
The cousins lift the trucker’s shirt, peeling it back to
reveal the vest, wanting to assess the damage.
TRUCKER
You broke my freakin’ rib, you
maniac son-of-a-bitch!
The cousins, satisfied with what they see, nod to each other.
Huh. It works. Standing up, Marco pulls out a ROLL OF
BILLS, counting off about eight Benjamins and letting them
flutter to the floor. Leonel picks up the two vests.
Then, the cousins turn and... walk away? Holy crap. The
surprising thing is that they don’t kill this guy!
The trucker, finally silent, watches them go. But as the men
climb out of his truck, disappearing from view, the trucker
can’t help himself. Flat on his ass, from deep inside the
trailer...

ACT THREE
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
CLOSE ON AN INDUSTRIAL THERMOMETER GAUGE. The needle
hovering around 175 degrees centigrade, measuring the
contents in a vat atop an electric heater. Walt’s face is
REFLECTED/DISTORTED in the glass as he moves in for a closer
look. Squinting. His finger TAP TAPS the thermometer.
WIDE -- Gale is setting a series of digital timers at one end
of the work space, while Walt studies the gauge. Both men
are in full Tyvek bunny-suits, but without gas masks. Walt
looks from the gauge to Gale, Gale to gauge... gauge to Gale.
What’s on his mind? Impossible to guess. Finally:
WALT
Gale. What temperature did you set
here?
GALE
Here? Station Five... seventy-five
c.
Walt shakes his head... no. No, no, no, no, no.
WALT
I said EIGHTY-five. Eight five.
Gale is in the crosshairs, and tries to be polite,
pathetically pointing to his clipboard.
GALE
No, I... I wrote it down. You said
seventy-five. I-I wrote it.
WALT
Well, you wrote it wrong! That’s
not what I said. I said eightyfive, it’s ALWAYS been eighty-five.
Not seventy-five, not ninety-five.
Eighty-five.

This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

Sorry.

Walt shuts off the heating unit... walking past Gale. We
hold on Gale, a little worried. I didn’t think I fucked
up... but I guess... I did? Poor Gale. As he moves to drain
the vat...
We find Walt. The wheels turning in his head -- is he guilty
he snapped at Gale? Did he not yell at him enough? We don’t
know what’s going on... but pieces are connecting in his
brain. An answer in there somewhere...
EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - MORNING
The sun rises slowly. A couple of beauty SHOTS show the
beginning of a new day.
INT. SCHRADER HOME - BEDROOM - MORNING
Hank eases in front of the mirror, trying to get the knot
right on his tie. He’s dressed for his OPR hearing, in a
sports coat and khakis. Fuck it... that’s about as good as
that knot’s going to get.
Hank sits on the edge of his bed, checking his watch, trying
to figure out the latest he can leave and still get in on
time. He’s dreading this fucking meeting. But he’s going to
face the music.
Marie appears in the open door way, still in pajamas. She
quietly examines her husband, until:
MARIE
You look nice.
HANK

Look like a TV weatherman...

nervousness.

There’s a long beat. Awkward, until Marie finally gets to
what’s on her mind.
MARIE
What are you gonna tell them?
Hank considers the question, but he’s already made up his
mind. The truth. But before he can voice that to Marie...
MARIE
Here’s what you’re gonna tell them.
He attacked you.
Marie pads over to Hank, sitting right next to him on the
bed. Hank sighs, echoing her words below his breath, knowing
he has to allow this fire to run its course before he can put
it out.
HANK
... he attacked me.
MARIE
He-he swung at you with
something...
HANK
... swung at me...
Marie is playing the whole scene out in her mind. She sees
it so clearly.

Baby, it wasn’t the right thing.

sorry. This whole Gale situation.
He’s-he’s just not working out.
We don’t hear the other side of the conversation, but Walt is
clearly talking to Gus.

but I think our first best option
is... Jesse Pinkman.

it.
Walt listens, sitting up straight. Receiving the
confirmation he had hoped for.
WALT
Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I
will. I will. Okay... goodbye.
Walt hangs up. He exhales, relieved, but scared... Did he
really believe all the stuff he’d been telling Gus? We’ll
soon find out, as Walt stands up and walks...
We finally see where Walt is. Already inside the hospital
where Jesse is admitted. Walt pads down the hall, toward
Jesse’s room, worried if he’s doing the right thing.

Jesse needs to see.
Walt has a pitch...

There’s been a job opening. I need
a new lab assistant.

How can he pass it up? And then:
JESSE
No.
Walt is perplexed.
WALT
I don’t think you heard --
JESSE

Let me understand this. You’re
turning down one and a half MILLION

It’s then that Jesse absolutely fucking EXPLODES...
JESSE
I am not turning down the MONEY, I
am turning down YOU! YOU GET IT?
I want nothing to do with you!
Ever since I met you, everything I
ever cared about is gone, ruined,
turned to SHIT... DEAD! Ever since
I hooked up with the great
Heisenberg.
This is a volcanic eruption, loud enough for people in the
halls to hear, aimed at hurting Walt. Walt absorbs the
punishment, growing sadder and sadder with each blow to his
psyche. Jesse doesn’t even know how right he is.

getting Jesse to join him complete folly.

You don’t give a shit about me!
You said I was NO GOOD! I’m NOTHING! Why would you want ME, huh?
You said my meth is ‘inferior,’

cook was garbage?! Screw you, man!

Walt pauses in the door, unable to look at the kid. But he
is able to say, with quiet sincerity:

And Walt leaves, shutting the door. Jesse stews, coming down
off the high the rage provided... but those last words from
Walt, sinking in. Bullshit.

Walt pulls into his driveway and parks, sad and defeated,
with Jesse’s devastating tirade still weighing him down. He
gets out of his Aztek, a long, sickening walk of despair
ahead of him... which we play out. Give it time... give it

Panic begins to build -- Hank’s PTSD. A wave is coming,

trying to stop the spinning in his mind. PTSD really hitting
hard now. Rapid breathing. A muffled RINGING in his ear.
God damn it, god damn it...
A BLUR in his rearview -- someone crossing behind him! He
turns. Just a WOMAN with a shopping cart, rolling along,
checking her receipt...
A CAR cruises by... someone looking for parking...
Hank squeezes his eyes shut... but what if this is real? He
needs to stay sharp. Beat this fucking thing. Open his
eyes. The clock...
3:07... 3:07... 3:08.
Hank sees the digital number change. He looks around.
Alright. Alright, alright, alright. This is all a joke, a
fucking mind game, damn it!
As he starts to calm down, catching his breath, Hank sees...
Ahead of him, over the roofs of the cars, the tops of TWO
BALD HEADS. He can’t see their faces, but we know who they
are. And Hank has a gut feeling: this is it. Two men coming
to kill you.
The cousins, after their long and winding journey to achieve
blood vengeance for their cousin Tuco, for their prayers to
Santa Muerte to finally be answered... are only moments away.
Hank sees they are several rows ahead, but then...
They walk off in separate directions. What the fuck... It’s
then that Hank loses sight of them -- two shark fins briefly
spotted, but then lost in the sea.
Looking around, are they gone? No. They’re approaching from
opposite directions behind Hank, down the alley of cars.
We still only see just the tops of their heads over the
parked vehicles. Hank can’t drive forward -- his only move
is ‘reverse,’ as he’s boxed in on all sides. Fuck!
Finally, behind him, one cousin (Leonel) eases into view, his
GUN aimed at Hank! Hank CRANKS THE ENGINE, SCREECHING into
reverse, as...

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - SAME
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!!! Hank’s rear window BLOWS! Bullets
seem to come from everywhere as the cousins FIRE at will.
Hank’s right bicep EXPLODES with blood as a bullet rips
through him! Painful, through the back and out the front.
Pedal to the floor, the Commander arcs back and...
SLAM! He HITS Leonel, CARRYING HIM -- his body leaning in
through the open rear window... until...
SMASH! -- the Commander rams into another car so this fucker
is pinned between them.
The impact causes the cousin to drop his gun... inside Hank’s
truck. Hank sees the loose weapon RATTLE toward him, and he
makes a desperate move for the gun, as...
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Hank’s HIP is shot once as bullets
pierce the driver’s door of the Commander.
The other cousin (Marco) FIRES round after round into the
Commander. Hank is out of his (and our) view as he is
crawling in the back to get the loose gun.
The cousin stops shooting -- where is Hank? The cousin
carefully approaches, looking into the window to see...
The back (passenger’s) seat door open, and HANK IS GONE. A
blood trail leading off from the scene...
Marco sees his brother slumped through the rear window,
pinned between the cars. He yanks the Commander’s gear shaft
into ‘Drive’ and lets it roll away... drifting until it
crunches to a stop against another car.
Leonel, free of the automobile vice, slumps to the ground.
Both legs SMASHED and bloody above the knees, one so bad that
it’s completely TWISTED AROUND.
Marco kneels next to his brother, seeing his gruesome
condition. No big emotions here, just weird steely calm.
Intense, as Leonel looks to his brother...
LEONEL
(Spanish - with SUBTITLES)
... finish him...
Marco gives a simple, determined nod. He will finish this.
The cousin moves off, gun in hand, following the BLOOD TRAIL
left by injured Hank through the winding expanse of cars.

On the hunt... it’s only a matter of time. The trail leads
up ahead, between another set of cars. As he approaches...
MAN (O.S.)
Jesus.
A self-absorbed PREPPIE SHOPPER in iPod headphones walks into
his path. Suddenly aware of this scary gunman, the preppie
stops and raises his hands, as if to say: “Hey, I’m nobody,”
but...
POP-POP! A quick SHOT to the gut and forehead, and the
bystander drops like a rock. Sudden... violent... it’s over.
The cousin swings his gun, something in his peripheral... a
FEMALE SHOPPER, looking right at him. He pulls the trigger,
but...
The gun slide is LOCKED OPEN... HE’S OUT OF BULLETS! The
woman runs off SCREAMING, her lucky fucking day.
Marco pulls a new CLIP out of his front pocket, and as he
does, we see: the BLACK DEATH BULLET falls out (the one the
Trucker handed him in Act Two).
The bullet tumbles and CLINKS to the ground next to his SKULLTIPPED BOOT. Slow-motion. Dramatic. So we’ll remember it
for later.
His gun reloaded, the cousin continues to follow Hank’s blood
trail, around the car before him. Where the fuck is he?!
But we see something the cousin doesn’t... behind him. Back
near where he dropped the bullet, HANK rises up from behind
the car! His GUN trained, locked on the cousin... he’s got
him! A breath to steady his aim, and then...
BOOM! The first shot spins the cousin around. Then:
BOOM-BOOM-BOOM! Three more bullets square in the fucker’s
chest! But... the cousin doesn’t go down? WHAT?! Hank’s
gun slide is LOCKED OPEN. He’s out of bullets. Hank sees...
The cousin takes aim. On Hank. Dead to rights.
BOOM! BOOM! Sudden, violent shots IMPACT with Hank -- his
right lung and lower left abdomen. Hank crumbles...
The cousin tears at his shirt in pain, revealing the
BULLETPROOF VEST beneath. That’s how he survived.
Marco makes his way over to Hank, a bloody mess on the
ground, gasping for breath. The cousin stands over him, gun
in hand.

Hank is a dead man. His breaths short, throat tightening...
Looking up at this gunman... Who the fuck is this? Why?!
This is how it ends? Hank grips the gun tight in his hand...
useless without any bullets. The slide lock open.
Marco looks down on his injured prey, ready to exact
vengeance... the final death blow, until... the cousin slips
the gun into his waistband?
MARCO
(Spanish, subtitled)
No. Too easy.
And then... HE WALKS AWAY?!
Wide-eyed, Hank watches him go...
ANGLE ON A CAR TRUNK. It pops open to reveal... a familiar,
silver-headed AX. The cousin lifts it out...
BELOW THE CARS, Hank catches a glimpse of the ax as it
touches the ground, making a horrible SCRA-AAAAAAPE noise as
the cousin drags it along the tarmac. Hank’s eyes focus,
adjusting, as he also sees...
THE BLACK BULLET. The one dropped by the cousin!
HANK -- the gun in his hand, the slide open and the empty
chamber... he needs that fucking bullet!
He reaches for it, rolling... crawling for his only hope...
in horrible pain as he stretches.
The cousin keeps coming... SCRA-AAAAAAAPE.
Hank gets his hand on the bullet, but it slips though his
fingers. So much blood... hard to grasp the slippery metal.
He’s getting weaker, losing blood quickly...
SCRA-AAAAAAAPE.
Time stretches on forever, as he finally gets a hold of the
bullet, but now he has to get it into the open gun chamber.
SCRA-AAAAAAAPE. The cousin lifts the ax off the ground,
approaching Hank.
Hank is face down, so the cousin can’t see that Hank is
trying desperately to load his gun. In fact, we have no idea
if the bullet makes it into the chamber!
Using his boot, the cousin wedges it under Hank and rolls him
over. He wants to see Hank’s face when the ax gets buried in
his chest.

As Hank is rolled, we see he holds the gun, but the slide is
still locked in the OPEN POSITION! Did he load the bullet?!
Marco slowly raises the ax over his head, milking this moment
for all it’s worth. He’s going to fucking enjoy this.
Revenge for Tuco. Revenge for his injured brother. Family
is all. But then...
Gun against his chest, Hank CLICKS the slide release, which
loads the bullet into the chamber. KA-CHICK.
HANK takes aim and...
KA-BOOM!!! We are above the cousin as the bullet RIPS
through his skull, a fountain of BLOOD into our LENS.
The body collapses in a heap, as the ax pinwheels and plants -
- THUD -- into the blacktop.
Hank lowers his arm to his side. Numb. His eyes on nothing
but blue sky now. Peaceful. But fading from consciousness.
WIDE. Hank is still. A weird silence over the lot, until...
