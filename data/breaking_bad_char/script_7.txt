TEASER
AN ABSTRACT IMAGE. A black square against a field of white
and grey. Quiet, still... kind of mesmerizing. We are
looking at the 4’x7’ Georgia O’Keeffe painting titled “My
Last Door,” a minimalist representation of the artist’s patio
door at her home in Abiquiu. This canvas hangs inside...
INT. ART MUSEUM - DAY
Many of us probably couldn’t identify this work of art, but
there’s one person who definitely doesn’t have a clue what it
even is, and that is...
... JESSE, who steps into the shot, his back to us. He looks
at it, his head tilting a little left, a little right. After
a moment of silent contemplation...
JESSE
Yo, I thought I was gonna see some,
like, vaginas.
He tells this to a YOUNG WOMAN, who steps into frame next to
him. A familiar silhouette against the lighted artwork, and
we soon reveal this is...
JANE. Yes, Jesse’s beautiful, dear, lost... dead Jane.
Telling us this is another FLASHBACK, sometime after their
planned Santa Fe visit in Episode #209, but before their
downward drug spiral of #211.
JANE
I didn’t say she actually painted
vaginas. I said some of her
paintings looked like vaginas.
JESSE
(re: this painting)
Uh, seriously? Not even close.
Jane smiles at his playfulness. He’s just bored and wants to
get under her skin. But Jane still makes an effort to
educate him, whispering respectfully in the museum...
JANE
Georgia O’Keeffe painted all kinds
of stuff. Everyday items. Her
surroundings. Some of it evoked
an... erotic nature. It’s who she
was.
Jesse squints at the square black hole in the painting.
(CONTINUED)
JESSE
Not like any vagina I ever saw.
(then)
This chick have medical issues?
JANE
This particular painting is of a
door.
Jane pads off, leaving Jesse to stare at the abstract portal.
He frowns, not convinced at all...
JESSE
Any other doors here we can check
out? Like, real ones, or...?
INT. JESSE’S TERCEL - DAY - LATER
The couple climb into Jesse’s Tercel, a lit CIGARETTE in
Jane’s mouth. Jesse is still a little dumbfounded, holding
his keys in his hand.
JESSE
Y’know, I-I-I don’t get it. Why
would anyone paint a picture of a
door? Over and over again, like
dozens of times?
JANE
But it wasn’t the same...
JESSE
Uh, yeah. It was.
JANE
It was the same subject, but it was
different every time. The light
was different, her mood was
different. She saw something new
each time she painted it.
Jesse’s not buying into this artsy-fartsy bullshit.
JESSE
And that’s not psycho to you.
JANE
Well, then... why should we do
anything more than once? Should I
just smoke this one cigarette?
Maybe we should only have sex once
if it’s the same thing.

CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
This gets Jesse’s attention... Don’t go down that road.
JESSE
Whoa. No...
JANE
Should we just watch one sunset?
Or live just one day?
(her point)
Because it’s new every time. Each
time it’s a different experience.
Jesse can’t argue with that -- but something is still rubbing
him wrong about the whole thing. And besides, he’s having
too much fun razzing her over this.
JESSE
Okay, fine. I guess the cow skull
pictures were cool, but... a DOOR?
I will say it again. A door.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...
Jesse lets out a fake SNORE, but he still doesn’t get under
her skin.
JANE
Why not a door? Sometimes you get
fixated on something, and you might
not even get why. You open
yourself up and go with the flow...
wherever the universe takes you.
Jesse sighs, he’s not going to win this one. He puts his
keys in the ignition and starts the car.
JESSE
Okay, so... the universe took her
to a door. She got all obsessed
with it and just had to paint it
twenty times until it was perfect.
Jane shakes her head -- not quite.
JANE
No. I wouldn’t say that.
Nothing’s perfect.
Jesse studies her and smiles.
JESSE
Yeah? Well, I mean... Some
things.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 3.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Meaning her. Romantic Jesse shifts over and gives her a
kiss. Jane intentionally (playfully) doesn’t lean in to make
it easier for him to reach. She smiles as he moves back.
JANE
That was so sweet, I think I threw
up in my mouth a little bit.
JESSE
(laughs)
You can’t admit just for once that
I’m right?! C’mon. That O’Keeffe
lady kept trying over and over
until that stupid door was perfect.
Jane smokes her cigarette -- shakes her head.
JANE
No. That door... was her home, and
she loved it. To me, that’s about
making that feeling last.
Jesse watches Jane take a final satisfying drag on her
cigarette, the filter stained with lipstick, and...
An ECU of the CIGARETTE being extinguished in Jesse’s full
ashtray. A remnant which we found last episode in #310, from
a moment Jesse wishes would have gone on forever.

ACT ONE
INT. HOSPITAL - PHYSICAL THERAPY ROOM - DAY
A PAIR OF FEET. Wearing hospital booties, lowering toward
the ground with a motorized HUMMMMMMM. The feet belong to...
HANK. He is strapped into something called an
Electromechanical Patient Lifter, which has him in a diaperlike harness attached to motorized cables that raise and
lower him. A PHYSICAL THERAPIST guides him between a set of
PARALLEL BARS. (This area should be filled with as much highend physical therapy equipment as we can get, probably in our
big redressed Waiting Room).
PHYSICAL THERAPIST
Okay, alright. Here we go. You
ready?
Sweat drips off Hank’s forehead as the weight shifts -- his
feet touch the ground, but only his arm strength is
supporting him. He’s clearly having trouble, his breathing
is labored... his legs have no power; little movement.
MARIE, SKYLER and WALTER JR. are here for moral support, off
to the side. Full of hope that he can do this, but...
The pain is too much. He wants to stop.
PHYSICAL THERAPIST
C’mon, gimme a step. Gimme one
step.
HANK
(struggling)
Nope. Nope. That’s it. Take me
up.
MARIE
You can do this, Hank.
(then)
C’mon, it’s supposed to hurt. Pain
is weakness leaving your body--
HANK
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.
Marie is a bit of a drill instructor here, and doesn’t mind
the abuse. Giving as good as she gets...
MARIE
Hey, if you can get your leg up
that high, I say go for it!
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 5.
(CONTINUED)
Hank’s arms shake. He’s falling. He can’t do it.
HANK
Take me up, take me up!
HUMMMMMMMM. The therapist slowly raises Hank back up, so his
feet are dangling a little. Marie remains strong, not giving
away any hint of disappointment. But Skyler gives her son a
comforting rub on the back, knowing how important Uncle Hank
is to Junior. The therapist remains positive...
PHYSICAL THERAPIST
Alright, coffee break. We’re gonna
let you rest for a minute, then
we’re gonna try it again.
HANK
Never mind about your “coffee
break.” Take me up. I’m done.
PHYSICAL THERAPIST
We’ll just pick up where we left
off.
Hank sees the concern and subtle pity on Sky and Junior’s
faces. It riles him even more. He looks at his wife...
But Walt Jr. tries to encourage and urge him on...
WALTER, JR.
C’mon, Uncle Hank. You can do it.
How else are you gonna get out of
here?
But something about this pisses Hank off even more. He locks
in on Junior and snaps...
HANK
Don’t you have any friends? I
mean, Jesus. Find something better
to do! I don’t need everyone
staring at me hangin’ here like a
camel’s ball sac.
Hank is a little mean and petty, but Junior isn’t hurt. He
understands (going all the way back to the Pilot when it was
awkward for him just to try on new pants).
SKYLER
Hank, he just wants to be
supportive--
But Walt Jr. softly interrupts his mom and aunt...
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 6.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
WALTER, JR.
It’s alright.
Walt Jr. moves toward the exit. Both Skyler and Marie
suppress the urge to lay into Hank, seeing him hanging there
in his debilitated state. Hank knows he was out of line too,
and part of him is sorry, but another part just doesn’t give
a shit.
MARIE
I’ll be right back, okay?
Skyler and Marie quietly follow after Junior. As they’re
leaving...
HANK
(to therapist)
Gonna get me out of here sometime
today?
INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Skyler turns back as hesitant Marie brings up what is, for
her, a delicate subject.
MARIE
Sky? We got our first bill. And,
you know, if you’re still
insistent...
SKYLER
I am.
Skyler holds out a hand -- let’s have it. Marie reluctantly
produces a folded piece of paper, hands it over. It’s Hank’s
HOSPITAL/THERAPY BILL.
MARIE
Prepare yourself.
Skyler unfolds the bill and locates the “Amount Due”. We
don’t see the total, but judging from Skyler’s reaction
(underplayed for her sister’s benefit), it’s pretty damn big.
MARIE
They’re gonna start coming in
weekly like that, so...
(then)
You’re sure you can do this?
Remember, this is the lie of “gambling winnings” Skyler told
her sister in #309. It’s Skyler’s plan to take Walt’s dirty
drug money and use it for good.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 7.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
SKYLER
Yeah...
Skyler nods... but not a confident one, as the enormity of
the situation hits her. Off her well-faked smile...
AN ABSTRACT IMAGE. A wavy SEA OF BLUE. We are in...
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
We’re looking straight up through a wavy, solid sheet of our
BLUE METH. It may take a beat to figure out where we are,
but once Jesse’s FACE appears in his Tyvek suit, we’ll
probably know.
He looks down through the “glass,” right at us, examining the
fine workmanship. After a few beats of us feeling like pet
fish in his aquarium...
Jesse raises a SCRAPER TOOL, and using the butt of it...
SMASH!!! Meth spiders out into beautiful broken aqua shards.
SMASH-SMASH-SMASH as he then breaks it smaller and smaller.
TIME CUT TO:
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
Jesse transfers the product into the usual Rubbermaid... but
as he works, he gets an odd feeling. He turns to see...
WALT -- watching him closely. Very closely. Creepy, like
Walt’s either going to kiss him or kill him. Okay...
Jesse goes back to his task. He seals the lid and moves this
LAST of FIVE BINS to the weigh station, but immediately, Walt
steps in.
WALT
I’ll do that.
JESSE
What the hell, man?
Jesse steps back, watching Walt zero out the scale and
calculate the weight.
JESSE
What, I can’t work a scale now?
But Walt says nothing, recording the weight onto a chart.
Jesse slow-burns, wanting to know what the deal is...
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 8.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
JESSE
This is bullshit. Just say it.
Just say the words. You think I’m
stealing?!
Walt holds a finger to his lips -- shhhh. He motions around
to the rafters, as if to say, “Bugs. They (Gus and company)
might be listening. Don’t use that word.” Walt returns his
attention back to the clipboard.
Jesse just shakes his head, full of mock outrage. Of course,
we know he’s stealing, but how dare this motherfucker accuse
him! Off of riled Jesse...
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
Establishing. Where Jesse attends his drug counselling. And
yes, this maybe could be DUSK.
GROUP LEADER (V.O.)
“Walk with who you are.”
INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
Jesse slips into a session already in progress. An averagesized group, including BADGER and SKINNY PETE, in their roundcircle setting, listen to words of encouragement from the
GROUP LEADER (last seen in #309).
GROUP LEADER
That was the phrase my sponsor used
with me, back when I first started
coming to meetings.
(scans faces)
It’s probably just a different way
of saying, “Be yourself.” Right?
But this idea of “walk” also tells
me that I have to move forward.
Badger and Skinny Pete actually seem to be into this message.
Listening carefully and nodding to these words of personal
motivation. Are they just playing along? We’re not sure.
GROUP LEADER
Always good advice, at least for
me.
(scans group)
I see we have some new people here
at Group. Couple of new faces.
See some hands? First time?
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 9.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Four hands go up around the circle, hesitant and unsure,
their first experience in group. One new girl, ANDREA (early
20’s, Latina) is the last to reluctantly raise her hand.
GROUP LEADER
Great. Welcome. Maybe we can go
around, introduce ourselves. Say
whatever’s on your mind.
(points)
How about you? You want to start
us off...
He points to Andrea -- pretty, alone, fragile. Jesse takes
note of her when she’s called upon. She’s uncomfortable with
all these new eyes on her, but she also has a toughness that
finally gets her to, “Fuck it, I’ll just do this...”
ANDREA
Yeah. My name is Andrea... and
uh...
Not really sure what else to say, she gives a brief shrug of
her shoulder. The Group Leader remains positive...
GROUP LEADER
We don’t bite. No judgements. You
can be as open and honest as you
want to be.
ANDREA
Honestly..?
(then)
I don’t want to be here.
She’s not being bitchy, or a hard-ass. It’s simply that he
asked, and she answered.
GROUP LEADER
Alright, fair enough. Who else had
their hand up?
As our group leader continues on, unruffled, we hold on
Jesse. Off him, eyeing Andrea...
INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER
CLOSE ON doughnuts being picked over. It’s after the
meeting, and group members gather around the free coffee and
snacks at a side table. Badger loads up as Jesse approaches
him and Skinny Pete, pretending not to know them (as “cover”
in their meth selling ruse).
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 10.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
JESSE
Hey. ‘Sup. My name’s Jesse.
BADGER
Well... hello, Jesse. My name is
Brandon. And this is, I believe...
Peter?
SKINNY PETE
Right. I’m Peter. How are you?
Jesse rolls his eyes at their suck-ass acting. He looks
around, walking them out of earshot of the rest of the group.
JESSE
I just, uh, wanted to give you a
heads up. It’s gonna get a little
slower smuggling product with, uh,
Grandpa Anus watching every move I
make.
(assures them)
Don’t worry. I’ll keep it flowing.
Badger and Skinny Pete don’t show relief or enthusiasm over
this news, just an awkward sideways glance.
SKINNY PETE
(faking it)
Great... Right on.
BADGER
Yeah.
JESSE
(glances around)
So, uh... how’zit selling? Mad
volume?
The guys look at each other and kind of nod, slowly working
their way down to...
BADGER
Yeah, it’s uh... you know, it’s
uh...
(finally)
It’s not so good.
JESSE
What do you mean? How much have
you sold?
BADGER
I sold a teenth.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 11.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
JESSE
One teenth?! That’s it?
(glances around at group)
To who?
Badger points meekly to Skinny Pete.
BADGER
To him.
Pete shrugs sheepishly, gives a little “Yo”-type nod and
wave. Jesse is stunned -- you’ve gotta be fucking kidding!
BADGER
Look, it’s not so easy selling to
these people. They’re here tryin’
to better themselves.
SKINNY PETE
Yeah, there’s like... positivity
and stuff goin’ on here.
Jesse is outraged. He wants to bust a gasket and yell, but
he can’t do it here. Instead, quietly:
JESSE
I’m out risking my ass to get
product for you two, and you’re too
pussy to sell?! You’re pathetic.
(fuming)
Y’know what? I want it back. All
of it. I’ll sell it myself!
BADGER
C’mon, man. Don’t be like that.
Selling to these people... It’s
like shooting a baby in the face.
It’s not natural.
SKINNY PETE
Yeah, Jesse. It’s not so easy like
you think.
JESSE
I will show you exactly how easy it
is...
Jesse turns and looks around the room, until his eyes land
on...
ANDREA -- who is having her court card signed by the Group
Leader. He’s giving some last words of advice to a few of
the newbies -- stick with this, it’s worth trying. But
Andrea is waiting to get her card back and split.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 12.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Jesse gives a last look back to his worthless salesmen, and
starts heading toward the exit. Just as...
Andrea gets her signed card back, also making her way toward
the door.
Jesse watches her as she moves -- a lion tracking the weakest
prey in the herd.
Jesse times his arrival at the door just ahead of Andrea.
About to exit, he pauses and smiles, moving as if to say,
“Ladies first.”
JESSE
Oh, hey. Sorry...
ANDREA
No. Go ahead.
But Jesse doesn’t go -- he’s much too sensitive a guy to push
ahead of a woman. Smooth, sweet, and to us... just evil.
JESSE
Andrea, right?
ANDREA
Yeah.
JESSE
Hey. Um, my name’s Jesse, and,
uh...
(private -- for them only)
I don’t really want to be here
either.
(beat)
Oh, uh... Sorry...
Off Andrea, heartened to meet someone who thinks like she
does, and no idea of what awaits her...

ACT TWO
BLACKNESS. An unknown RUMBLE sound, muffled, like we’re
underwater. And it turns out, yes, we are underwater, as a
lid comes off a metal pot -- we’re LOOKING UP from the bottom
through boiling water. Not in the Super Lab, but...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING
Skyler moves into view above us, her face looking down as she
salts the water. After a beat, she dumps in a fistful of
pasta -- SPLOOSH!
WIDER -- out of our specialty shot -- we see Skyler also has
a pot of sauce and meatballs bubbling, a bowl of salad, and a
loaf of Italian bread on a cutting board. She cranks a
cooking timer as through the main room walks...
... Walter Jr. He eyes the dining room table, seeing there’s
THREE PLACE SETTINGS.
WALTER, JR.
Aunt Marie’s coming to dinner?
Skyler wipes her hands with a towel, answering with carefully
measured nonchalance:
SKYLER
No. Your Dad is.
Really? Off Junior, smiling at this unexpected surprise...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Two hours later. Empty sauce-smeared plates tell us that the
dinner is well over, as we find Walt in his old chair with
baby Holly cradled against his body.
WALTER, JR.
(playfully)
How’d you get her to sleep so
quick? Are you that boring?
WALT
I’m “comforting.” I’m a comforting
presence.
As Walt rises to place sleeping Holly in her nearby bassinet,
he shoots a smile to Skyler, who sits nursing a glass of
wine. Sky is politely noncommittal. Just... even. But if
we’re judging by Junior’s mood, the meal went well.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 14.
(CONTINUED)
Walt, Jr. reaches in his wallet, pulls out his INSTRUCTIONAL
PERMIT from the New Mexico DMV and holds it up for his folks
to see (we do NOT need to show it particularly well -- we
especially DON’T want to make out the date and year).
WALTER, JR.
Hey, so check it out. See what
this means? Check out the date.
Next Thursday is officially six
months that I’ve had my learner’s.
Which means...
(hooray!)
... I can get my provisional and
start driving by myself.
WALT
(returning to the table)
Since when? You don’t turn sixteen
for two more months.
WALTER, JR.
Doesn’t matter -- it’s a
provisional. Look it up! They
changed the law like, ten years
ago.
Walt looks to Skyler -- you onboard with this? She already
knew, and shrugs -- yep.
WALT
Well, I didn’t vote for that.
WALTER, JR.
Doesn’t matter if you voted for it.
It’s the law.
(again playful)
So both of you start thinking about
what kinda car you wanna buy me.
SKYLER
Mmm.
WALTER, JR.
I think I’d be good with either an
old IROC or a ‘Stang.
SKYLER
Ah. A “’Stang,” mm-hmm?
WALT
How about something with playing
cards in the spokes? Makes a nice
motor-y sound.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 15.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
This is refreshing -- Mom and Dad together goofing around
with Junior. It’s been a long time since we’ve seen that.
Walter, Jr.’s been kinda starved for it, in fact. Grinning:
WALTER, JR.
Ha, ha dad. You’re not going to
get off that easy.
Alas, all good things end. At this lull in the conversation:
SKYLER
Well, I think this is um... we
should probably table this
discussion for later. Your Dad and
I have a couple things to talk
about, so...
Junior sighs. He gets up, gathering his crutches and heading
to his room.
WALTER, JR.
Okay. A 1971 Mach 1 fastback in
Grabber Lime... with a shaker
hood... ‘Stang.
WALT
I’ll write that down so we don’t
forget.
(fake-pats his chest)
A darn. No pencil.
Mom and Dad smile as their son exits... but then they make
eye contact with each other. Walt’s here for other business.
TIME CUT TO:
INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Reaching in a pocket of his own nearby jacket, Walt offers
Skyler a plain white, unmarked ENVELOPE (unsealed). Skyler
nervously nods thanks. Here’s the moment of truth.
She opens the envelope and slides out a CASHIER’S CHECK (we
won’t see the amount, but just in case, it’s $10,000).
Skyler examines the check a moment, grateful, but then...
curious. Confused. She finally has to break the silence.
SKYLER
What is “Ice Station Zebra
Associates?”
Walt wasn’t expecting questions, so he’s a little thrown.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 16.

(CONTINUED)
WALT
It’s a loan-out. It’s fine.
SKYLER
Whose loan-out?
WALT
It’s fine. Really. I have a guy.
Hmm. Skyler’s radar is now WAY up.
SKYLER
Ohhh-kay... um, does your “guy”
know the tax code and regulations
for New Mexico? Cause, there’s
very specific paperwork that has to
be submitted quarterly on this.
WALT
(nodding; absolutely!)
Yes. My guy is a TOP guy...
SKYLER
Who is he? What’s his name? What
are his qualifications? Walt,
this...
(lowers her voice)
... money has to be unimpeachable
when it reaches Hank and Marie.
WALT
And it is. It will be.
SKYLER
But, how do I know that? I mean,
apparently you can’t even tell me
the man’s name.
Exasperated, Walt thinks he can call her bluff.
WALT
Jesus, Skyler. You really want to
know? I mean, d’you you really
want to know?! Really?
Big mistake. Off Skyler’s resolute face -- Absolutely.

INT. SAUL’S OFFICE - LOBBY - DAY
In a snazzy ONE-ER, we PAN ACROSS a thicket of gang-bangers,
cheats and troglodytes who are waiting for the legal services
of Mr. Saul Goodman, Esq. to find...
... Walt and Skyler. Skyler is in a slight state of shock --
even she didn’t expect it to be this bad. Off Walt, watching
her closely out of the corner of his eye... realizing a bit
too late that this is probably a HUGE mistake...
INT. SAUL’S OFFICE - DAY - LATER
CLOSE ON Saul’s “University of American Samoa” diploma.
Skyler stands staring at it, deadpan and unimpressed. Behind
her we find SAUL GOODMAN, definitely impressed (and slightly
flummoxed) to be meeting pretty Skyler.
SAUL
Hell. Welcome. What a pleasure it
is to have you! I’m just gonna
call you Skyler, if that’s okay.
It’s a lovely name. Reminds me of
a... big beautiful sky. Walt never
told me lucky how lucky he was...
prior to recent unfortunate events.
Walt watches nervously as his two worlds collide -- Saul
fawning over the tall-drink-of-water that is Skyler, and
Skyler uneasy that she might accidentally pick up a social
disease from the charged and shifty shyster that is Saul.
SAUL
Clearly his taste in women is the
same as his taste in lawyers: only
very best with just the right
amount of dirty.
(laughs; off her stare)
That’s a joke. That’s a joke.
It’s funny because you are so
clearly very classy. Here, please,
sit down.
Saul pulls out a chair for her. When she’s not looking, Saul
gives a quick eyebrow-raise of approval to Walt for landing
such a looker. Walt tries not to notice, taking his own seat
as Saul rounds to the business side of his desk.
SAUL
So. Walt tells me that you have,
uh, some concerns I can alleviate.
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 18.
(CONTINUED)
As Skyler scans the big “Constitution wall” behind Saul...
SKYLER
Uh, yes I do. I have... concerns.
No shit. Glancing sidelong at Walt, you don’t have to be
Kreskin to read her mind. How the fuck did you end up with
THIS guy? Yet Skyler politely presses forward...
SKYLER
Um, if we’re going to go down this
road... and clearly we are, for the
sake of my brother-in-law...
SAUL
I’ve heard about him. Uh, he’s an
American hero.
Nodding, Saul gives out with the cheesy sympathy like a
discount undertaker. Skyler pauses flatly, then continues.
SKYLER
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we’re gonna go about this in a
manner that is extremely safe and
cautious.
SAUL
Fair enough. I’ll walk you through
the process. First step is
something we like to call “money
laundering.” Alright, take you’re
money were represented by say...
these jelly beans.
WALT
Uh, Saul...
Saul sets out a jar of jelly beans, meaning to pitch the same
simplistic “Money Laundering 101” he gave to Jesse in #309.
Walt tries to warn Saul with a quick shake of his head.
SKYLER

actually, I know what money
laundering is.

SKYLER
And as with most things, the Devil
is in the details. So to begin
with, what are we saying is the
source of this money?
SAUL
That’s simple. Walt here came up
with a great story about gambling
winnings. Blackjack, right? Some
card-counting system?
WALT
(quiet discomfort)
Um, actually that was Skyler’s
idea.
Really? Saul’s eyes widen at Skyler, impressed.
SAUL
Well. You grow more gorgeous by
the minute!
(then; shrugs)
Well, there you have it. I’ll
generate false Currency Transaction
Reports out the wazoo, as well as
the necessary W-2Gs. I know a
couple casino managers who will
jump at the chance to report false
losses. So, win-win for everyone.
SKYLER
But you can’t sell that for very
long --
SAUL
(interrupts)
Yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you. Uh,
we declare just enough so as not to
arouse suspicion. Then, Walt’s onetime winnings become seed money for
investment.
SKYLER
Investment in what?
SAUL

SKYLER
Laser Tag.
SAUL
Yeah. There’s guns and glo-lites,
and kids wear the vests and runa
round in teams--
SKYLER
(interrupts)
Yeah, I actually know what it is.
It just that... in relation to
Walt, it’s, I mean, it doesn’t make
any sense.
Walt is a silent, sick observer as these two go at it.
Saul’s patience rapidly frays as she questions his methods.
Trying to sound like he’s joking:
SAUL
Makes more sense than you two being
together! I’m still trying to
figure out how that happened...
SKYLER
Do you even know Walt? I mean, how
would he, of all people, buy a
Laser Tag business? It-it doesn’t
add up.
SAUL
It adds up perfectly. Walt’s a
scientist. Scientists love lasers!
Skyler stares at him flatly. The wind leaves Saul’s sails.
SAUL
Plus, they got bumper boats. So.
SKYLER
“Hey everybody, Walt suddenly
decided to invest in laser tag!
Just out of the blue!” Really?

So. Thank you for stopping by.
Saul is done. Skyler stares at him -- they’re at stalemate.
Off Walt, not wanting to make a move to remind either of them
that he’s sitting there...
EXT. ANDREA’S HOME - DAY
Establishing. A small house somewhere in the barrio.
INT. ANDREA’S HOME - DAY
Andrea’s face appears near a lamp in her living room,
reaching under to feel for the switch. She clicks off the
light, leaving only the sun sneaking through the drawn
curtains. Andrea plops on the couch next to...
Jesse. And the two start making out. Damn, our boy works
fast -- he is in! As Jesse starts moving a little too fast,
unbuttoning her shirt...
ANDREA
You want a beer or somethin’?
JESSE
(smiles)
Or somethin’? What do you mean?
Jesse kisses her neck as she laughs.
ANDREA
Like beer. I’m cleaned out of
anything else. Even if I wasn’t,
we’re not supposed to.
JESSE
Yeah. I’ve heard it... over and
over and over again. Y’know, don’t
you think it’s ridiculous that
society says beer is okay, and a
little hit of something... sweet is
wrong?
She keeps gently kissing him, but he keeps selling...

energy fighting the urge not to
use, and I feel like crap ‘cause of
it...
ANDREA
I know. It’s just...
JESSE
What?
ANDREA
I can’t get caught using again.
Jesse looks her in the eyes. Something painful behind them.
For a moment, it seems as if Jesse is going to soften...
maybe it’s not easy to do this, like the guys said. Then:
JESSE
The thing is... not to get caught.
(then)
You ever try that blue stuff that’s
going around? Just a little gas in
the tank and... suddenly everything
is interesting.
(half to himself)
Man. I wish I could make that
feeling last.
Jesse is smooth in his seduction... and evil... as he builds
up the desire for meth, tempting Andrea with each word.
ANDREA
Like I said. I got nothing here.
Jesse nods, waiting for the right moment to say...
JESSE
What if I could get some?
Andrea seems open to it. Yes. What if? But before Jesse
can close the deal...
The front door OPENS. A FIVE-YEAR OLD BOY runs in, followed
by Andrea’s GRANDMA (50s), who carries two bags of groceries.
BROCK
Mommy! Mommy!

Jesse and Andrea quickly compose themselves as the boy,
Andrea’s son BROCK, runs to her.
ANDREA
Hey, baby. Your nana brought you
home early.
(to grandma)
Grandma, I thought you were keeping
Brock today?
Grandma eyes Jesse, not too pleased.
GRANDMA
I was, then I saw your car. I
thought you had a meeting.
ANDREA
I did, but we changed the time.
(points to Jesse)
Grandma, this is Jesse. He’s from
the meeting. He’s like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.
Jesse gives a half-hearted, uncomfortable nod and wave.
Grandma sets down the groceries and leaves, muttering
disparaging words in Spanish.
GRANDMA
(in Spanish)
I’m tired... tired of you all.
SLAM goes the door. Jesse adjusts in his seat to see...
Brock at the edge of the couch, staring at him.
ANDREA
(feeling awkward now)
Jesse, this is Brock.
Andrea gathers the groceries and carries them into the
adjacent kitchen, putting them away. Brock, a cute kid,
keeps staring at Jesse.
JESSE
(to Andrea)
So... you, uh, you have a kid, huh?
She nods. Jesse and the boy stare at each other a moment,
and a softer side of Jesse, the old Jesse, seems to come out.
JESSE
‘Sup? Brock, huh. That’s a cool
name. Here. Give it up...

He holds out his fist to Brock, who takes a brief moment...
but then gives Jesse the “fist bump” that he was waiting for.
This really amuses Jesse, who we haven’t seen smile this big
in a long time. We can tell the kid likes Jesse, too.
ANDREA
Brock is almost six. You okay?
With kids?
JESSE
What? Yeah, yeah... He’s cool.
Brock smiles. He likes being cool. Stepping back amongst
them, Andrea takes Brock by the hand and guides him away.
ANDREA
Okay, Brock is gonna go play in his
room while the big people talk.
He’s gonna go play with his Legos,
and his cars... Say “Bye, Jesse.”
BROCK
Bye, Jesse.
ANDREA
You have a good time at
Grandma’s..? Oh, I fixed your blue
car, remember... the convertible
one? Play with your toys...
Jesse gives the kid a smile and a wave. As Jesse is left
alone, he rises, looks around. Maybe wondering what the hell
he’s doing here. Thoughts run through his head... about his
own brother? About the red-haired boy from Episode #206?
INT. SKYLER’S JEEP - DRIVING - DAY
Skyler is behind the wheel, stewing. She and Walt are coming
from their disastrous Saul powwow. Silence, until...
SKYLER
Safe and cautious, that’s all I’m
asking -- and that man is neither.
Walt sighs.
WALT
I’ll admit he comes across like a
circus clown... but he actually
knows what he’d doing.

Walt considers her. Screw it -- he makes a big confession.
WALT
Skyler, this isn’t just about what
happened before. My involvement in
this is... ongoing.
(stresses)
Understand?
Walt hasn’t said this out loud to Skyler before, but makes it
crystal clear: he is still manufacturing. Skyler doesn’t
really react. She knew already. How could she not?
WALT
I can’t just quit. I have a...
something of a contract.
(off her glance)
It’s all very safe and
professional. Structured. But I
can’t simply quit.
Heavy stuff. What’s Sky gonna say to all of that? Nothing
so far. She’s inscrutably silent. At a stop sign, she puts
on her blinker -- CLICK CLICK. CLICK CLICK. Walt is a
little confused as she makes a turn.
WALT
Where you going?
But she speeds away in silence...
EXT. STRIP MALL LOT - DAY - MINUTES LATER
A big, empty parking lot at an old strip mall or somesuch.
Out of the distance appears the old Jeep, motoring toward us.
It pulls to a stop in f.g., Skyler and Walt staring out their
windshield past us.
Walt knows where he is -- he just doesn’t know why he’s here.
We don’t see what he and Skyler are studying.
SKYLER
If you’re gonna launder money Walt,
at least do it right.
Skyler climbs out. After a beat, Walt joins her to look at:

story people will believe. Not
Laser Tag. This. This is what we
buy.
Walt looks at her... what we buy?
SKYLER
You. This is what you buy.
She corrects herself without urging, but still... Skyler is
at a level of acceptance Walt would have never dreamed could
happen. Off Walt, eyeing this possible business venture, and
an uneasy new stage in their relationship...

ACT THREE
EXT. CHURCH - DAY
A NEW DAY from the end of Act Two -- new wardrobe. Jesse
leans against a wall, having a post-meeting cigarette.
Several other GROUP MEMBERS mill about, doing the same.
Here comes Skinny Pete and Badger, exiting the meeting,
Badger still munching on a big doughnut. The guys approach,
a little wary to see Jesse -- did he make his sale?
Automatically dropping into “We don’t know each other” mode:
BADGER
Hey, uh...
(snaps; “remembering”)
... Jesse, right?
(presenting himself)
Brandon... Peter. How goes it?
Hanging in there?
Jesse sighs and shakes his head, tiredly exasperated.
JESSE
Please, just..? Dumbass.
BADGER
Sorry, man. Just trying to keep it
on the D.L.
SKINNY PETE
(glances around; hesitant)
So. You and that girl. You do the
deed yet?
JESSE
Do what?
SKINNY PETE
You know. Sell to her?
He says it low. Jesse remains cool, shakes his head.
Jesse realizes -- they think he didn’t have the balls to go
through with slinging meth to Andrea. Irritated:
JESSE
What are you two even doing here? --
SKINNY PETE
What d’ya mean?
BREAKING BAD #311 "Abiquiu" AS BROADCAST 28.

JESSE
You can’t get your nut up to sell,
what’s the point of even coming?
Pete and Badger share another look -- isn’t it obvious?
SKINNY PETE
Homie, I’m on, like, Step Five --
This is totally sincere -- Skinny’s really trying to do the
right thing here. Jesse stares at him, open-mouthed. Then
he looks to Badger -- and you?
Badger throws two fingers in what looks like a gang sign --
but what he’s really saying is that he’s at STEP TWO.
BADGER
Deuce, yo. I’m catching up.
Off of Jesse’s disbelief, he spies... Andrea, emerging from
the church, scanning for Jesse. He stubs out his cig, makes
a bee-line for her.
JESSE
Whatever. Later.
Badger and Pete stare after Jesse as he catches up with
Andrea. The boyz both watch as they slip casually into each
other’s arms and head off together.
ANDREA
Hey!
SKINNY PETE
Dude needs to come into the fold.
BADGER
Yep.
Badger and Pete nod, sad for Jesse and his evil ways.
INT. TACO SAL’S - NIGHT
Jesse, Andrea and young Brock are seated at a booth in this
mom & pop eatery. Clearly, Jesse’s not following through on
his meth-selling. Instead... the trio are having a nice
family-type dinner.
JESSE
Hey, you know what? I have magical
powers. You wanna see? Ready?
Jesse does a small hand trick.

BROCK
That’s not real.
JESSE
It is real. Alright, D’you want to

this. Watch this. Ready?
Jesse crunches down the PAPER WRAPPING off a straw into a
small wad. Jesse makes sure Brock is watching, and he is.
He’s fascinated with Jesse. Andrea watches him too, a little
wistful... maybe wondering if this is the guy who might be
around for her son... but it’s way too early to tell.
Jesse loads the straw with some water out of a cup (capping
his thumb over one side to trap the water in). He drips some
drops onto the paper wad, and...
The paper slowly EXPANDS like a worm. Brock smiles.
JESSE
You like that? That’s science and
stuff, makes it do that.
BROCK
Do it again.
Jesse smiles, wanting to please, but Andrea chimes in.
ANDREA
Let Jesse eat his dinner, Brock.
JESSE
It’s okay... It’s okay. Wanna see
it again?
Andrea smiles at Jesse, having to be the mom.
BROCK
Can you do a trick with
firecrackers?
JESSE
Firecrackers? Um, you know, I have
any firecrackers on me. Who does a
trick with firecrackers?

Tomás.
Hearing this name, Andrea grows a bit uncomfortable.

And... we don’t talk about him.
Andrea returns to her meal. Jesse doesn’t press her -- it’s
her business, after all. But he can’t help but be curious.
ANDREA
Come on... Eat your food, Brock.
JESSE
Can I have your chip? I’m gonna
steal your chip.
BROCK
Hey, that’s mine!
As this pleasant dinner continues...
EXT. CAR WASH - DAY
CLOSE ON a “LAWYRUP” license plate. We RISE UP off it (it’s
the rear plate, of course -- no front plates in The Land of
Enchantment) until we’re looking through the rear window of a
parked CADILLAC. The backs of two men’s heads are visible
within. The men stare out at the familiar CAR WASH in b.g.
SAUL
That’s it? That’s what you wanna
buy?
NEW ANGLE -- the Caddy is Saul’s, of course. And here he is
behind the wheel, Walt seated beside him.
The wary look in his eyes tells us Saul isn’t loving the
idea. For his part, Walt probably isn’t doing the world’s
greatest job selling it -- this is Skyler’s plan, after all.
However, being a good devil’s advocate, Walt shrugs.

WALT
People will believe it, at least.
I worked here four years.
Saul frowns, raises an eyebrow. Sounds sad.
SAUL
“Wax-on, wax-off” -- was that you?
(then)
Hey, how come you guys always give
with the air freshener? I
explicitly say I want no air
freshener and every time I drive
away smelling like an Alpine
whorehouse.
Walt’s not listening. His attention is elsewhere.
Walt’s POV -- a bushy-eyebrowed MAN stands in the wipe-down
area, berating an employee (we can’t hear what he’s saying).
Fans will recognize him as BOGDAN, Walt’s former boss.
Walt’s attitude here is hard to gauge. Sure he despised this
man and this place... but is there a certain nostalgia in his
eyes, a yearning for simpler times?
SAUL
All due respect, I don’t see it.
So, I vote, I vote no.
WALT
It makes a better story than your
Laser Tag...
SAUL
Is that you talking... or Yoko Ono?
WALT
(stifles his annoyance)
She has a point. It makes more
sense that I invest right here.
SAUL
Based on her years of experience in
money laundering, I suppose.
(before Walt can argue)
Lemme tell you something -- if
you’re committed enough, you can
make any story work. I once
convinced a woman that I was Kevin
Costner, and it worked because I
believed it. Alright? It has

SAUL
Besides, this dump isn’t gonna work
because it doesn’t have a Danny.
Okay? There’s no Danny here!
WALT
What in god’s name is a Danny?
SAUL
Danny runs the Laser Tag. Danny is
the guy who had a vision. Where
others saw a dirt lot, he saw black
lights, rubber aliens, teenagers
running around with ray guns,
right? He was like Bugsy Siegel in
the desert. And when the stock
market took a shit and Danny got in
trouble, he went searching for
exactly the type of situation that
we’re offering. Okay, Danny will
look the other way to keep his
dream afloat. In other words,
Danny can be trusted. Completely.
(points to Bogdan)
That guy? The guy with the, uh,
the eyebrows-that-won’t-quit? Is
he a Danny?
Walt looks to Bogdan again. The answer is clearly no.
SAUL
You buy this place, all you got is
a big building that squirts water.
You got no Danny here.
As Walt absorbs this, and Saul starts the engine...
INT. ANDREA’S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER
CLOSE ON a cigarette getting stubbed out in an ashtray. It’s
Andrea, reaching across Jesse to get to the end table.
It’s afterwards. She and Jesse are naked in bed (of course,
this will be handled discreetly), as she lays her head down
on his chest. Jesse smokes his own cigarette, propped up by
a few pillows. Quiet. Maybe even wistful. Is he thinking
of Jane? After a beat:

Wait, whoa... what? You said the
kid is coming home...
ANDREA
Yeah, in a few hours.

She rises, not caring she’s naked (discreet glimpses only).

Nobody can say I don’t take care of

Jesse feels a touch of regret. But she’s on a tear now.

Andrea trails off abruptly, feeling like she’s shared too
much -- and with a guy she’s suddenly none too sure about.
Glancing at him, she quietly -- and a bit self-consciously --
completes the thought.

JESSE
It’s not what I want.

Look... I was outta line... talkin’

ANDREA

We both were.
Jesse settles back. He’s going to stay. Andrea is quietly
relieved that he is.
JESSE
You’re right. I don’t know what
you’ve been through...

You can tell me if you want.
Andrea considers, takes a drag. Then:

the streets. They sorta took Tomás
in. No Dad around...

Eight years old, they Tomás
slinging. Part of some crew.
Then... when he was ten, for some
initiation or somethin’...
(glancing briefly at him)
They made him kill somebody.
Jesse is silent. It’s so horrible, there’s nothing to say.
ANDREA
I heard the rumors. Didn’t believe
it at first. But then I saw him
like a week later. And he told me,
yeah, he did it. They gave Tomás a

Jesse blinks. It’s a horrible story, but now... something in
it piques his interest. Hiding it, his voice even:
JESSE
Off of Central. Like, over by the
train tracks..?
(she shrugs, nods; maybe)
When was this?
ANDREA
Few months back.
Jesse lets it sink in. Uneasy.
JESSE
What else did he tell you?
ANDREA
He shot the guy right through the
neck. Shot him dead. Just ‘cause
he was working the wrong corner.
Andrea tells it matter-of-factly. It’s heartbreaking, but
she’s been over it so many times in her head, it’s numbing to
her now. Jesse, however, is focused on something else.
A dealer shot in the neck a few months ago. Jesse puts these
pieces together -- was it Andrea’s brother who killed our
COMBO?! (Ep. #211)
ANDREA
It won’t happen again. Not to my
son.
Jesse hardly hears her now, his mind reeling with questions.
Is it possible he’s found Combo’s killer? And if so... what
is he going to do about it?

Oh, I’m “healthy enough,” huh?

You don’t need to be in a hospital.

And not before.
He turns his face away from her, too angry to even look at
her now. Off Marie, not sure how to handle this...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Walt and Skyler sit in the living room, their body language
indicating Walt is still more of a tolerated guest than a
partner. Mid-private-chat:
SKYLER
Wh-what’s a “Danny?”
Walt does his best to explain -- sotto so Walt, Jr. (who is
presumably home) doesn’t hear.

WALT
Danny’s an accomplice. Someone
who’s in on the scheme, who knows
about the laundering. Who’s paid
to look the other way.
Skyler considers, nods. Makes sense. Walt presses on.
WALT
And, while I agree with you that
Laser Tag is a hard sell, without a
Danny, the car wash isn’t really an
option.
SKYLER
And he can’t get you another Danny
to run the car wash.
WALT
(shrugs; no)
Easier said than done. If we’re
looking for someone trustworthy..?
They sit here a beat. It’s settled. Laser Tag, it is.
But for Skyler... no, it’s not. This is the last thing she
wants to offer, but for the sake of keeping them safe:
SKYLER
What about me?
Walt is not sure he heard her right.
WALT
What about you?
SKYLER
Me. I’ll be the Danny.
Walt, appropriately, freaks.
WALT
No, no, no. Skyler! That is not a
good idea --
SKYLER
I’m perfectly capable of managing a
small business --
WALT
A legal business! Not this!
SKYLER
Who else would we trust?

WALT
No.
SKYLER
Walt, I’m in this, and if I’m in
it, I’m gonna do it right.
WALT
You are not in this! You are
NOT... IN this!
SKYLER
We’re married. How am I not in
this?
WALT
We are not married, Skyler, we’re
divorced!
(then; peering at her)
Right..?
SKYLER
(a bit sheepish now)
I never actually got around to
filing the papers.
Walt is stunned. And god knows, Skyler is NOT sitting here
saying she WANTS to be married to Walt -- not at all. Truly,
she’s got something else on her mind. Something imminently
practical. Quietly, gravely:
SKYLER
Married couples can’t be compelled
to testify against one another. So
there’s that.
OFF Walt, head spinning, seeing Skyler in a new light...
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
Another day’s cooking. Walt and Jesse quietly go about their
business, Jesse prepping one of the large stainless TANKS for
venting, Walt testing ph levels on some vials.
Both are deep in thought, much on their minds, but Jesse is
particularly lost with all that he’s heard.
As Jesse works a lever (or whatever is at hand, and makes
sense), Walt slips his mask on, knowing noxious fumes are
about to be vented. He notices Jesse doesn’t do the same.
WALT
Jesse... Jesse.

Jesse stops, looks to him. What?
WALT
Your respirator.
Jesse realizes his mistake. A dangerous mistake. But with
his head mired in thought, Jesse doesn’t stop to thank Walt
or react to the error. He just nods.
JESSE
Right.
Walt eyes his partner -- you okay? Before he can probe Jesse
further... RING. A loud industrial PHONE BELL goes off.
Walt and Jesse share a look -- never heard that before.
RING... RING. They slip off their masks, looking around.
Focusing on the wall-mounted PHONE. RING. Walt is
particularly nervous, already paranoid about being listened
to -- who could be calling??
His nervousness is infectious -- Jesse, too, looks a bit
freaked. RING. They share another look -- guess we should
answer it. Walt finally does.
WALT
... yes?
We don’t hear who he’s talking to... but from his attitude it
must be someone important. Jesse grows more curious.
WALT
Uh... yes. Okay... okay. I’ll be
there.
Finally, Walt hangs up. Ponders this call.
JESSE
What was that?
WALT
An invitation.
Invitation to what? Off this mystery, we CUT TO:
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT
A DOOR. A flat composition, recalling the Georgia O’Keeffe
painting that started the episode. Then... WALT steps into
the shot, his back to us.
WIDE. We see Walt in front of a neatly kept home in a nice
upper-middle-class suburban neighborhood.

(CONTINUED)
His Aztek parked out front. We realize this is the site of
the mysterious invitation... but whose house is it?
Walt knows -- and seems quite wary. He steps to the door and
KNOCK-KNOCK...
Walt waits. We hear approaching FOOTSTEPS... the door
UNLOCKS. It swings open to reveal...
GUS FRING. Restaurateur. Meth kingpin. The man Walt now
knows was behind the shooting of Hank. Gus smiles, wiping
his hands on a dish towel as he greets Walt, looking every
bit the kindly homeowner.
GUS
Ah, Walter. You’re right on time.
Please... come in.
Walt gives a polite yet hesitant nod as he steps into...
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Walt glances around as he steps through the door -- it looks
normal enough. No armed thugs, no Scarface-type decorations.
It looks like... a home.
Gus shuts the door and faces Walt. Walt doesn’t know what
he’s in for -- did Gus find out about Jesse stealing? Will
he be taken to task? Is this the end of Walter White?
Then...
GUS
I hope you like Paila Marina...
Gus walks off. Walt stands a frozen beat. As he follows...
GUS
It’s a fancy name for fish stew.
It sounds like a cliche, but
indeed, it’s just like my mother
used to make.
Moving with subtle caution, Walt follows after his host,
taking in the sights of Gus’s inner sanctum. Looking around,
it’s... tasteful, modest... god, it’s... normal. Shockingly
normal. Cozy even. As Walt moves, he sees...
On the floor of the living room, there’s one or two
children’s TOYS (generic -- like a plastic riding toy or
dolls, whatever we can get). Some of the cabinets and
shelves may have family photos, but we never want to get
close enough to see any details of faces (in case we want to
cast these roles in later episodes).

(CONTINUED)
There’s no sign of any other family members here currently,
but the home certainly feels lived in. Can we be sure this
home is actually Gus’... who knows?
GUS
Come on. You can help me cook.
Walt continues through the place, into...
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Gus washes vegetables at the sink as Walt enters this wellappointed kitchen. High-end pots and pans -- someone who
loves to cook lives here. Dinner is halfway prepared.
GUS
This is a Chilean dish that I love,
but... I never get to make it.
Kids won’t eat it. But, uh... You
know how that is.
Expecting trouble around every corner, Walt is surprised he’s
not finding any. Nodding distractedly...
WALT
Sure.
Gus leaves the sink and reaches for a large and very sharp
CHEF’S KNIFE.
GUS
Do you mind...?
He surprises Walt by HANDING him the blade, handle-first.
GUS
Wwould you slice the garlic? Very
thin.
Walt examines the blade in his hand. He can SEE HIMSELF
reflected in the shiny stainless.
Walt looks up from the knife, considers Gus... who has turned
his back to attend to some shallots frying on the stove.
It’d be so easy for Walt to plunge this knife into Gus. Is
this a test? Gus giving him the opportunity for vengeance to
see what he will do? Or is this some twisted show of trust?
Walt has to know -- and asks a simple question. Carefully
keeping his voice even, not sounding too suspicious:
WALT
Why did you invite me here?

Gus gets that Walt is wary. No sense pretending he doesn’t.
Doing his best to put him at ease, he gives Walt a faint --
yet somewhat warm -- smile.
GUS
We’re working together... why not
break bread together?
Walt considers. Nods. Sounds... legit. Gus, still smiling:
GUS
Now... the garlic?
Walt again glances at the knife in his hand and the garlic
before him. Off him slicing it thin, just as he was told:
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
An hour later. Over their jointly prepared meal (which looks
quite good, Gus is no slouch in the kitchen!), Walt is still
on-guard, but less so. He knows Gus is a master chess
player. But is there a move here? And what is it?
While they eat...
GUS
It always amazes me... the way the
senses work in connection to
memory.
(re: his plate)
This stew is simply an amalgam of
ingredients. Taken separately,
these ingredients alone don’t
remind me of anything. Not very
much at all. But in this precise
combination? The smell of this
meal..? Instantly, it brings me
back to my childhood. How is that
possible?
WALT
(almost sheepish)
Basically it all takes place in the
hippocampus. Neural connections
are formed. The senses make the
neurons express signals that go
right back to the same part of the
brain as before. Where memory is
stored. It’s, um, something called
relational memory...
(then)
Don’t quote me on that. I-I’m
rusty on my biology.

Gus is pleased to finally have Walt part of the conversation.
GUS
That’s very interesting.
He probably really means this. Walt nods... but he still
can’t be comfortable. What the fuck is this meal about?!
Sensing his discomfort...
GUS
Walter. I would like to help you,
if I could.
WALT
Help me how?
GUS
Well, when I first started out, I
made a lot of mistakes. More than
I care to admit. I wish I’d had
someone to advise me. Because this
life of ours... it can overwhelm.
(a beat)
You’re a wealthy man now. And one
must learn to be rich.
(smiles faintly)
To be poor? Anyone can manage.
Gus sips his wine. Walt studies him.
WALT
What advice do you have for me?
Gus considers. Then, nodding to himself, satisfied that he’s
come up with a good one, he declares:
GUS
Never make the same mistake twice.
Said simply... delivered in a totally casual, friendly
manner... and yet what does it mean?
Walt nods. Fair enough. But he can’t shake the idea that
there’s something more to this. That maybe it’s a warning.
Off Walt and Gus, eating...
EXT. URBAN STREET - DAY
We don’t know where we are at first. Just some shitty,
lesser-traveled part of ABQ. No place familiar, far as we
can see. Into this frame drives...

... Jesse’s TERCEL, slowing to a stop before us. Parking.
Jesse looks out past us through his windshield. He climbs
out, taking his time, surveying the area. Then, he casually
makes his way across the street.
At which point we REVERSE, revealing (at least for those
viewers with a good memory for such things) the STREETCORNER
on which poor Combo was murdered.
And there, in the distance, a young Hispanic kid hangs out,
tooling around in slow, aimless circles on his BMX bike.
Jesse walks toward him, not too fast, hands in his pockets.
We may recognize this kid from Ep. #211 as COMBO’S KILLER.
A touch older, a little harder... this is TOMÁS, Andrea’s
little brother.
JESSE
Hey.
The kid eyes him, putting on his best gangsta airs.
TOMÁS
Wassup?
JESSE
You, uh, you Tomás?
(off his non-answer)
I heard you were the man.
TOMÁS
Yeah? What you want?
Jesse, playing a part, shoots a quick, nervous glance around
the neighborhood, keeping his eyes peeled for cops.
JESSE
Um, crystal. You think you could
hook me up?
Tomás looks him over. Finally:
TOMÁS
Three hundred.
JESSE
For a teenth? Shit, c’mon, yo.
TOMÁS
Three hundred.
Jesse looks around. Ahh, fuck it. He exposes a wad of BILLS
from his pocket -- Tomás slows him with a hand.

(CONTINUED)
Put that away, man! Jesse is clearly playing this as if he
were a naive white guy buying drugs in the barrio.
Tomás now NODS to a distant, familiar CAR parked around a
corner. Which noses into view. It slowly motors our way.
It pulls up alongside Jesse, who does his best to look
nervous (alright, maybe it’s not all an act). Inside the old
muscle car are two familiar BULLETHEADS -- the dealers who
ordered Tomás to kill Combo.
JESSE
Hey, ‘sup.
One of the Bulletheads shuts him down with a LOOK. Then the
thug gives a quick “hand it over” flick-flick of his fingers.
Jesse nods, counts out two hundred and hands it over.
The guy takes it, counts, glances to Tomás... and then the
two Bulletheads drive off. They round right back to their
opposite corner, the one they were parked on originally.
Jesse blinks -- where’s my dope, yo?!
JESSE
Hey! Yo!
Jesse glances back at Tomás behind him... who unceremoniously
shoves a TEENTH BAGGIE in Jesse’s hand. This is the set-up,
apparently: the two Bulletheads hold the money while the
underage kid holds the METH. If he gets busted, he’s only a
minor, while the two hardass creeps in the car likely skate.
His purchase gripped in hand, Jesse hesitates, staring down
at young Tomás. The kid frowns up at him.
TOMAS
Bounce.
Jesse does as he’s told -- for the moment. He turns and
walks back toward his parked Tercel.
We PULL Jesse along, letting Tomás recede deeper and deeper
into b.g. As we stay here on Jesse, Steadicamming him
along...
... His expression DARKENS. To a cold place we’ve never
quite seen before. As we desperately wonder what our Jesse
is thinking... and planning...
