PLAYGROUND CRIME SCENE
TEASER
EXT. THE CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY
MUSIC STARTS -- a chirpy and cheerful mid-60s pop tune.
You’ll recognize it immediately.
Under it, a familiar MOTEL SIGN stands out against the sky.
WIDE now to reveal the sign stands beacon before our infamous
“Crystal Palace” MOTEL -- last seen as the site of Jesse’s
bust by the DEA in episode 203.
And in the parking lot of the Palace... a lone female figure.
A working girl. She glances over as an old beater comes
chugging into the lot.
CLOSE -- the working girl is WENDY, our lovable meth whore
(and Jesse’s sometime-squeeze). It’s been an unbelievable 22
episodes since we saw her last, and we missed her!
She flicks away her cigarette and falters over on her tall
platform heels, climbing in the passenger seat of the beater
which has pulled up before her. The DRIVER is some creepy
Tom Clancy-type, but hey, a job’s a job.
The SONG which plays beneath is “Windy,” by The Association.
It will run throughout our Teaser.
THE ASSOCIATION
(singing)
Who’s peekin’ out from under a
stairway --
Callin’ a name that’s lighter than
air --
Who’s bendin’ down to give me a
rainbow --
Everyone knows it’s Windy!
“Who’s bending down to give me a rainbow” should hit at just
the moment Wendy’s head disappears from view beneath her
john’s dashboard. Because after all, we can always use
another Peabody Award for Excellence in Television.
The pacing here is sprightly. Essentially, we’re building a
music video that depicts a day in the life of Wendy.
Her existence centers around the Crystal Palace, so we’ll
never stray too far from it (at least till Teaser’s end).
Her main activity and source of income is giving quick,
around-the-block blowjobs -- which means all day long she’s
getting picked up by different cars and trucks, driven around
the block, then let off right back where she started.
(CONTINUED)
Throughout this set-to-music MONTAGE (for which we should
provide on-set PLAYBACK), Wendy’s pulse seldom goes above 60.
Her blank, bored expression tells us she doesn’t despise her
life -- she simply doesn’t think about it. She might as well
be twisting bolts on an assembly line.
THE ASSOCIATION
(singing)
Who’s trippin’ down the streets of
the city --
Smilin’ at everybody she sees --
Who’s reachin’ out to capture a
moment --
Everyone knows it’s Windy!
Crucial to shoot is a HIGH AND WIDE TIME-LAPSE of the lot,
with Wendy getting in and out of various vehicles. As clouds
scud overhead in pixilated fast-motion, she goes around the
block in ten or twelve cars (representing a timespan, at
least in theory, of four or five hours). She doesn’t get
into every car that cruises her, as every now and then
somebody doesn’t like the price she’s charging.
We intercut this time-lapse with scenes of downtime, as
Wendy’s day involves a lot of standing around or sitting on
the stairs. Amongst these moments:
-- Wendy buys cans of ROOT BEER from the motel soda machine.
As established, she’s a big fan of root beer, so this is
something we can keep cutting back to.
-- Wendy eats take-out Asian food from a white Styrofoam
tray. She bends back one of the tines on her plastic fork
and uses it to pick her teeth.
-- Wendy talks trash with our tattooed and horned DEVIL MAN
(last seen in episode 213). Throughout all these moments we
certainly might record production sound... but the conceit is
that we’re hearing MUSIC, not dialog.
-- Wendy stands idly smoking. She picks something off her
tongue, peers at it. Huh.
-- Screaming at a customer who underpaid, Wendy throws her
can of root beer at him as he drives off. It bounces off the
back of his station wagon, jetting mocha-colored FOAM.
-- Around the side of the motel, Wendy squats behind the
dumpster, taking a tinkle. She smokes, staring into space.
THE ASSOCIATION
(singing)
... And Windy has stormy eyes --
that flash at the sound of lies --
BREAKING BAD #312 "Half Measures" AS BROADCAST 2.

(CONTINUED)
And Windy has wings to fly -- Above
the clouds, above the clouds, above
the clouds...
-- Wendy talks more trash, then gets in a tug-of-war with a
big TRANSVESTITE HOOKER (last seen in 205) over a rabbit fur
coat. Wrestling outside her weight class, she loses.
-- Add to these moments whatever seedy/fun/evocative bits of
business our director might add. Shooter’s choice!
INTERCUT WITH:
INT. THE CRYSTAL PALACE - WENDY’S ROOM - DAY
Inside her room here at the Palace (established in 102 and
203), we intercut Wendy taking regular meth breaks.
-- CLOSE ON her glass pipe as she fires it up, deeply
inhaling white clouds of the stuff she’s living her life for.
Hands down, this is the best part of her day.
THE ASSOCIATION
(singing)
... And Windy has stormy eyes --
that flash at the sound of lies --
And Windy has wings to fly -- Above
the clouds, above the clouds, above
the clouds...
-- Wendy checks her stash, frowning at the fact she’s running
low. The 8-ball she’s holding has maybe only three or four
hits left. She taps it with a finger.
-- Wendy counts her cash. Getting close to enough. She
tucks it back in some clever hiding place that other junkies
hopefully won’t discover.
-- Her tall shoes kicked off, Wendy lies propped on her bed
with her knees up in front of her, smoking a cig and staring
blankly at her television. What’s on TV should not be seen,
as we don’t want to have to pay for it. Instead, the box
throws flickering blue light throughout the darkened room.
Off this hellish, miserable existence, ironically set against
a bubble gum SOUNDTRACK...
EXT. STREETCORNER - DAY
CLOSE ON Wendy’s platform heels clip-clopping the sidewalk.
We TRACK LOW, following behind them.

CLOSE following behind the greasy FAST FOOD BAG that dangles
from her hand.
Andrea’s little brother TOMAS -- Combo’s ten-year-old killer -
- rides idle circles on his bicycle in f.g. as Wendy walks
through frame in b.g. The kid is bored. He pays no
attention to her, nor she to him.
WIDE to reveal a familiar intersection in a rough part of
town. We saw it at the end of our previous episode, and
before that in the Teaser of 211. This is where Combo died.
Wendy heads for an old muscle car parked inconspicuously
across the way from the kid. Inside it sit our two familiar
BULLETHEADS. They’re the creeps who ordered Combo’s murder.
They know Wendy well, aren’t surprised to see her. Likely,
she’s one of their best customers.
WENDY
Hey guys.
She hands them the bag of burgers (more on that later) and
bends down to bullshit with them through the open driver’s
window. She’s their very best friend in the world just as
long as they’re selling.
Wendy shoots a quick glance around for cops, then slips the
guys a wad of her hard-earned cash. Off this close,
objective angle...
INT. TERCEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
... MATCH-CUT to the same activity as now seen in JUMPY,
EXTREME TELEPHOTO. This long-lens view tells us we’re inside
someone’s covert surveillance. We watch as the BULLETHEAD
DRIVER takes Wendy’s money and slips her an 8-ball of METH.
She tucks it in her pocket, keeps talking. The guys unwrap
the burgers she brought them and eat. They keep their eyes
peeled as they chew, though they never quite look our way.
They seem to tolerate Wendy because she gives them food, and
probably the occasional BJ.
Off this WIDE VIEW:

Reveal that it’s JESSE slumped low behind the steering wheel
of his parked Tercel. He’s by himself, watching these dudes
from a couple blocks away.
Jesse keeps staring out his windshield.
Off our Jesse, with hate in his heart, grim determination in
his eyes... and now, a dawning IDEA...

ACT ONE
INT. AZTEK - DRIVING - AFTERNOON
CLOSE -- hands on a steering wheel, properly situated at ten
and two o’clock. ADJUST to reveal they belong to WALTER, JR.
Yes, our young man is growing up. He’s DRIVING through the
White’s own neighborhood (some side street or other, so that
we’re not currently within sight of the actual house).
Keeping his eyes properly peeled through the windshield, he
shoots a quick glance to the seat next to him. After a
moment, he hazards another.
Walt’s not nervous the way he was the last time he gave his
son a lesson (back in ep. 204). Maybe it’s because Junior is
doing much better this time around. Or maybe it’s due to the
fact Walt has been through so much life-changing shit since
then that a car crash is the least of his worries.
WALTER, JR.
So if it’s okay, I was thinking I’d
use this one for the test.
(off Walt’s glance)
Mom’s brakes are very sticky and
you barely press down on them and
it’s like screeech.
WALT
Sure.
Walt nods. Fine. Another beat of silence, then:
WALTER, JR.
But I’m good?
WALT
Yeah, you’re great. Why?
WALTER, JR.
Um... are my feet okay?
He asks this meaningfully. Walt glances down into the
driver’s side foot well.
Walt’s POV: Junior has one foot on the GAS PEDAL and the
other poised over the BRAKE. We may recall this was their
big bone of contention last time. Walt hated it.
Before Walt can answer, Walter, Jr. is already explaining.

(CONTINUED)
WALTER, JR.
I looked it up -- New Mexico says
all I need is a note from a doctor.
(off Walt’s shrug)
I-I know it’s not the “right” way
and all. But once I get my
provisional, I can keep working at
it.
WALT
(a beat)
Well, as long as it gets you safely
from point A to point B, then who
am I to argue?
He says it matter-of-factly. He’s resigned, but not bitter.
Walter, Jr. is more than a little surprised.
Is there something more to read into this? Has the fight
left Walt altogether? Is “Heisenberg” dead and buried?
Off Walt, okay with being driven and not driving...
INT. WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON a LAPTOP SCREEN -- it shows a Wikipedia entry on
“MONEY LAUNDERING.” We slowly scroll through it, reading.
Educating ourselves. This is the POV of...
... SKYLER, sitting at the dining room table, her laptop in
front of her. She steeps herself in the complexities of
criminal enterprises while breast-feeding BABY HOLLY.
SKYLER
(softly, to Holly)
Hi! You’re a sweet girl... yes you
are... yes you are... yes you are.
(beat)
I know...
The sound of TIRES out in the driveway turns her attention.
She closes her laptop and gently disengages her daughter.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS
The Aztek is parked in the driveway. The engine shuts off
and Junior opens his driver’s door, retrieving his crutches
from the backseat. Walt rounds from the passenger side.
WALTER, JR.
Here you go... Got it.

Walter, Jr. grabs his backpack, nods. Walt hugs him goodbye.
WALTER, JR.
So, nine AM Saturday.
WALT
Nine AM Saturday.
WALTER, JR.
So which means pick me up about
8:30..?
WALT
I’ll be here with bells on.
WALTER, JR.
What?
WALT
Just a saying... Don’t worry. I
won’t be wearing bells.
Walt is ready to climb in his car and go. But just now,
Skyler exits the house (sans baby), headed their way.
SKYLER
Hey.
WALTER, JR.
Hey, Mom.
SKYLER
(to Walt)
Hi. Um, do you have a minute?
(off his nod; to Junior)
Could you, uh, go in and keep an
eye on your sister for me?
Walter, Jr. takes that as his cue to head inside the house.
WALTER, JR.
Yeah, sure. Alright, seeya, Dad.
WALT
Bye, Son. Hey, good work today.
WALTER, JR.
Thank you.
Walt gives him a smile and a wave. Skyler and Walt remain
standing here beside Walt’s Aztek, Skyler waiting for Junior
to get some distance before she says what’s on her mind.
Once she does, her voice stays low.

(CONTINUED)
SKYLER
Have you thought anymore about what
we discussed?
WALT
“Thought anymore” meaning
“reconsidered?” No.
She’s not happy to hear it.
SKYLER
So, show me the flaw in it.
WALT
(with emphasis)
Uh, flaws, Skyler. Flaws plural,
not singular. Where do you want me
to start?
SKYLER
Hey, I don’t love this situation,
alright? That you put me in!
However, let’s just stick with what
makes sense here: You took the
seed money you won gambling, you
invested it in the car wash that
you helped run for four years. You
hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
because guess what? She’s actually
a bookkeeper. Now, that is a story
an auditor can believe. So what am
I missing?
WALT
You’re missing that you should just
take this money that I give you and
not look too closely at it. So if,
god forbid, I get caught... you
maintain plausible deniability.
Skyler pins him with a withering look.
SKYLER
Okay, my estranged husband, who --
when he was working -- made fortythree thousand dollars a year,
starts shoveling money at me. And
when the police come, I’m supposed
to say “Gee, I, uh, never thought
about it, officers. Made sense to
me!” Really? That, in your mind,
is “plausible deniability.”
(off his silence)
I tell you what, Walt...

(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
I’d rather have them think I was
Bonnie what’s-her-name than some
complete idiot.
Walt considers her. Clearly, she’s serious about all of
this. She gives no sign of giving in or changing her mind.
Walt mulls his options. If you can’t beat ‘em...
WALT
So you’re promoting caution here.
And you want a believable story.
SKYLER
That, it seems to me, is the safest
way to make the best of a very bad
situation, yes.
WALT
Ah. But I’m noting a little hole
in your plot, though. Why would
your “estranged” husband be doing
all this for you?
Wary Skyler quickly sees where this is headed. Cocking her
head and giving back as good as she gets:
SKYLER
Because he loves his family and
desperately wants a reconciliation.
Though it may be hopeless and
futile... then again, he’d try
anything.
WALT
I’m just not buying it. No, I-I
think it would be better if the
husband were no longer estranged.
Maybe if he were back sleeping in
his own bed...
SKYLER
Wow. Suddenly a fantasy story.
Realizing this is a battle he will only lose, Walt instead
turns it into a negotiation.
WALT
I am at least going to be a part of
this household. Dinner with the
family, every night of the week.
SKYLER
Not every night, no.

SKYLER (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
WALT
Six nights a week. You get one
night off.
SKYLER
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.
With twenty-four hours’ notice.
WALT
(no fucking way)
Five nights a week, with no notice.
SKYLER
Three. Six hours’ notice.
WALT
Five nights a week, with two hours’
notice.
SKYLER
Four.
(as he opens his mouth)
Don’t push it.
Walt considers, sighs... then nods (all of that horse-trading
should play pretty fast, but not sitcom-fast).
WALT
And I want my own key to the house.
SKYLER
No.
WALT
(nodding; non-negotiable)
For emergencies, and for
appearances, yes. I am going to
babysit my own daughter, I’m going
to help my son with his homework.
I am going to be a part of this
family. And that is how we’ll sell
your little fiction.
Off Walt, not backing down...
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
A new day. We’re looking straight up at bright lights and
ductwork from INSIDE the huge stainless MIX/COOK TANK.
We hear a warning BEEP... BEEP... of machinery. A HISS of
hydraulics.
BREAKING BAD #312 "Half Measures" AS BROADCAST 11.
CONTINUED: (4)
(CONTINUED)
Into view above us parks a steel chemical DRUM turned on its
side. It’s balanced on the business end of our stand-up
FORKLIFT.
Jesse climbs into view, reaching to yank the CAP off the top
of the drum with a beefy pair of pliers. Reddish-brown
METHYLAMINE gushes down onto us, obscuring our view.
NEW ANGLE -- Jesse watches the chemical GLUG-GLUG out, his
mind preoccupied by a great many things. He climbs down off
a stepladder poised beside the vat. He steps back aboard the
forklift and JIGGLES the now-empty drum with it, making sure
to shake out the last few drops.
Walt wanders into view, scanning a clipboard he has in hand.
While not exactly whistling here, he’s likely in a better
mood than usual, considering the inroads he has recently made
with Skyler.
Jesse stands above, studying Walt a moment. Sizing him up.
Reaching a decision:
JESSE
How ‘bout we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?
Walt glances up from his clipboard. Did he just hear right?
Seems like a really out-of-the-blue request.
WALT
Uh. No thanks though. Maybe some
other time.
JESSE
Seriously. Get a beer with me.
Sounds casual enough... only Jesse isn’t asking. Walt stares
up at the kid, confused. Jesse eyes him meaningfully, in a
way that seems to say Let’s talk. Only not here, in this
place you think may be bugged.
Not waiting for an answer, Jesse expertly wheels the forklift
around and goes driving off on it, putting away the empty
barrel. BEEP... BEEP... BEEP. Off Walt, staring after him:
EXT. BAR - NIGHT
To establish -- this is an old-school neighborhood place,
nothing fancy. Maybe we can grab this special, on the fly?

INT. BAR - NIGHT
CLOSE ON a glass of Coke. Teetotaling Jesse (remember, he’s
in recovery) is not drinking alcohol. He’s not even drinking
his soda, come to mention it. His mind is elsewhere.
Walt sits before him, a beer mug in hand. The two of them
sit in a booth or somesuch -- some spot in this half-full
place which affords them privacy.
Walt senses the kid has something big on his mind, and he’s
curious to hear it. He’s patient, too, until finally...
WALT
What?
Glancing up at him, Jesse reaches in his pocket and pulls
something out. He tosses it atop the scarred table between
them. Walt frowns, recognizing it.
Walt’s CLOSE POV -- it’s a TEENTH baggie of BLUE METH.
Walt’s hand slaps down atop it, obscuring it from sight. He
shoots a quick yet subtle glance around the place -- did
anyone see that? Relieved no one did:
WALT
What the hell are you doing? --
JESSE
That’s ours, right?
(points)
Look at it and tell me if that’s
ours.
What the fuck?! Walt takes the briefest glance at the teenth
under his palm, then shoves it back at Jesse.
WALT
Yes, it’s ours. Now put it away.
What the hell is wrong with you?
(Jesse tucks it away)
Where did you get that? Did you
take it from the lab?!
JESSE
I bought it from the two guys who
killed Combo.
Walt settles down. Returns to being confused. Staring
intently, Jesse quietly spells it out for him.
BREAKING BAD #312 "Half Measures" AS BROADCAST 13.
(CONTINUED)
JESSE
They had Combo shot down in the
street, and now it’s our product
they’re selling. Which means they
work for our guy. Right?
Already not liking where this is headed, Walt tries to keep
things reasonable. Even-keeled.
WALT
Wh-what is that? That’s hearsay.
Do you have any proof?
JESSE
I heard it from the sister of the
kid who shot him.
(then)
You hear how I just said “kid?”
This kid -- he’s eleven years old.
Shot Combo on orders. These two...
scumbags. They got him dealing,
they got him...
Jesse trails off, not wanting to say it again -- as the whole
thing makes him emotional, and he’s trying hard to stay calm.
JESSE
You know he’s not the first. They
use kids ‘cause hey, why not? Easy
to control. Easy to fool. All
they get is juvie if they ever get
caught. Hearts and minds, right?
Get ‘em young and they’re yours
forever.
(off Walt’s silence)
These guys killed Combo. They used
this little kid like some puppet.
They used him to shoot my friend.
Jesse sighs raggedly and lapses into silence. He stares at
the tabletop between them. A wary beat.
WALT
So why are you telling me this?
Jesse eyes Walt evenly. He’s back in control of himself.
JESSE
I need your help.
WALT
(not wanting to know)
... How?

JESSE
I need ricin.
WALT
Oh my God. Uh... God.
Walt silently shakes his head -- absolutely, positively not.
JESSE
These two...
WALT
No.
JESSE
Hey, they gotta go, alright? I got
the entire thing figured out.
WALT
No.
JESSE
The delivery method, everything.
All I need from you is the poison,
that’s all.
WALT
No.
JESSE
Look. Otherwise, you don’t haveta,
you don’t gotta lift a finger.
WALT
No. Listen, you don’t even know
what you’re talking about. Not
even --
JESSE
-- You don’t get how right this is?
You don’t get how the whole entire
world would be better off?
WALT
I know we’re not even talking about
this.
JESSE
I know a woman who buys from these
two once or twice a week. Alright?

She brings ‘em hamburgers ‘cause
they sit in their car all day and
they get hungry, so she brings ‘em

off her price. There’s your
delivery system right there. I can
be a mile away.
WALT
(arguing despite himself)
Jesus. A meth-head you’re trusting
to do this.
JESSE
You know what? That meth-head
stood up to your brother-in-law,
alright? He questioned her five
hours and she didn’t give it up.
You know how it is you know it?
‘Cause you’re not in prison right
now!
WALT
Yeah, well I know I would be in
prison after this. Prison or
worse. And I’d be right alongside
you.
(tries to make him see)
Jesse... you cannot be serious.
This-this is a ridiculous idea.
JESSE
It’s ridiculous? What, so you’re
saying it’s not gonna work? How
about back when it was YOUR plan?
Back when we were gonna use it on
Tuco?
WALT
Apples and oranges.
JESSE
Guy eats ricin -- two, three days
later he gets the flu or a heart
attack or something and keels over.
That’s what you said. Untraceable
back to us!
(corrects himself)
To-to me. Not even that other
scumbag we work for is ever gonna
figure it out. Yo, it was a good
plan back when it was Tuco, and
it’s a good plan now.

WALT
Tuco... wanted to murder us. These
guys... don’t. Apples and oranges!
Do-do I really have to sit here and
explain the difference to you?
Jesse’s eyes glow at Walt, but his voice gets low and even.
JESSE
Combo was us, man. He was one of
us. Does that mean nothing?
WALT
(realizes something)
Why didn’t you go after these guys
two or three months ago? Huh?
JESSE
‘Cause I just found out about ‘em.
WALT
What’s to find out? It’s a dispute
over turf, right? I mean, how hard
could it have been for you to track
them down on their turf and kill
them months ago?
(before Jesse can answer)
Because back then you were too busy
getting high. Feeling sorry.
Walt isn’t being cruel. He’s trying to connect, to help.
WALT
Now, murder is not part of your
twelve-step program. This is not
some... amends you have to make.
What you are talking about here is
pointless. This achieves nothing.
It accomplishes nothing.
Jesse keeps staring at Walt for the longest time. He’s not
even angry at him. He’s simply bewildered. Calmly, quietly:
JESSE
If you can’t see what it
accomplishes... then there’s no way
I can explain it to you.
Jesse reaches in his pocket, pulls his wallet and counts out
cash. Walt wants to keep him here, keep him talking.

WALT
Jesse, listen to me... You are not
a murderer. I’m not, and you’re
not. It’s as simple as that.
Jesse drops some money on the table to cover their drinks.
He’s not acting petty or pissy about this, nor is he leaving
in a childish huff. He’s behaving like a proper grown-up.
One who isn’t going to waste his breath. He rises.
WALT
Jesse...
JESSE
I’m doing it. With or without you.
Serious as a heart attack. With that, he calmly walks out of
the bar, never once looking back.
Walt twists in his seat to stare after him... then faces
forward again once Jesse is gone. Off agitated Walt,
wondering how in the hell he’s supposed to deal with this:

ACT TWO
INT. HOSPITAL - HANK’S ROOM -- DAY
UP ON: a TABLE covered with a picked through chocolate
assortment, hand lotion, wadded up Kleenex and a wilting
stalk of purple flowers -- detritus of a long hospital stay.
NEW ANGLE: MARIE, HANK and WALTER, JR. are playing CARDS.
Hank’s sitting up, his guests perched on opposite edges of
his bed. They use a serving tray for a card table.
Walter, Jr. picks up from the pile. Thinks a moment, then
discards. Now it’s Hank’s turn. He picks up a card, shakes
his head, disgusted, and almost immediately discards.
(Note: They’re playing “knock rummy” here. In this game, if
you think your cards will add up to the lowest score, you can
knock and challenge the other players. Lowest hand wins.)
Marie’s turn. She picks up a card and considers it... at
length. Contemplating her next move like she was Boris
Spassky. Hank sighs, impatient. Sometime this year, maybe?
Finally Marie makes her move, setting down her hand.
MARIE
Knock! Knock!

Okay?

HANK
Yeah, we’re not sure about that.

Why not?
MARIE

That’s what they said because they,

So... people in wheelchairs should

CLOSE ON a HAND playing with the Scales of Justice. Pull
back to show: Walt. Sitting on the couch, absently fiddling
with Saul’s garish, non-ironic coffee table CENTERPIECE. He
sits anxiously, waiting, waiting...

into his computer screen. Hmm... what could Saul be working

Huh? What the hell? Why are these two just... sitting here?

He promised me that he would be

Oh, he “promised”? Why didn’t you

Walt sits there, staring off, like he hadn’t heard.

That’s why I’m here, Saul.
(half to himself)
The way he was talking..? He is
going to do it. Or try, at least.
SAUL
Okay, so, what? We pay him off.
WALT
No, no. It’s not about money...
it’s about getting him off the
streets. Getting him to calm
down...
Walt stops. A thought forming. A crazy thought...
WALT
Maybe..? What if we..? Maybe...
could you get him arrested?
SAUL
(frowns, dubious)
You-you want your criminal
associate taken into police
custody?
WALT
No, no, listen. I know it sounds
risky, but it wouldn’t be anything
that would get him into real
trouble and nothing that could lead
back to our business. Just some
minor offense.
If it seems like Walt’s reaching here, you’re right, but
sometimes desperate times call for half-baked ideas.

litter along the highway.
SAUL

That’s jail.

You’re talking about a level 2
joint.
WALT
Something that keeps him off the
street for say, 30 days? Then, by
the time he gets out, tempers have
cooled and hopefully we can move
on.
Saul mulls it over. It’s certainly not the most brilliant of
Walter White plans (it’s been awhile since we saw one of
those) but Saul always enjoys a challenge.
SAUL

Well, you know, Roswell
Correctional’s pretty low impact,

recommended Springer, but I’m
hearing chancy things about their
bathrooms since they renovated.
So.

So it-it’s possible?

Well, it falls under my Premium

rustle, rustle -- its a lot of gack. Half pound. Maybe
more.
NEW ANGLE shows: it’s Jesse’s hand. He’s pulled a chair up
to the bed where Wendy sits cross-legged, alternately deephitting on a cigarette and gnawing at her nails.
JESSE
(low, intense)
You understand what you have to do?
Wendy’s looking away, she’s actively not looking at Jesse and
all that dope.... calling out her name...
JESSE
And you can never talk to anyone,
right? I mean ever, understand?
WENDY

Yeah.
JESSE
I found this stuff on the internet.
Takes days to kick in. Just keep
quiet and this won’t ever come back

You’re okay with this, right?
Wendy shrugs -- she’s obviously not okay.
JESSE
(steadying)
Just think of it like it’s the same
thing as always; you’re just
delivering some hamburgers.
WENDY
It’s not just delivering
hamburgers.
Ah, the refreshing moral clarity of a meth whore. But Jesse
doesn’t relent. He continues to gently push.
JESSE
Hey. You got a kid, right? What’s
his name?
WENDY
Patrick.

Okay so, these guys using kids like

Wendy gives a barely perceptible nod.
JESSE
Good.
He stands and drops the bag of meth on the TABLE -- thunk.

duties. He has Holly on a blanket on the living room floor,
where she lies on her back.
WALT

Yeah... I’ll bet that tastes good.
There’s a KNOCK on the door, interrupting this bonding time.

Walt hesitates. He’s not crazy about letting this guy inside

closing the door quickly after Mike enters.

Aw, isn’t she somethin’. I got a

Uneasy about these two worlds of his colliding, Walt picks
her up and loads her into the bassinet.

Okay. So? What’s the problem?
Mike sighs. He’s about to go out on a limb here for Walt.
And not for the first time, either. For some reason, Mike’s
always kinda had a soft spot for him.
MIKE
The problem is... the Boss wouldn’t
like it.
WALT
Saul?
MIKE

Your boss.
Mike works for Gus?! This is news to Walt. Troubling news.
It’s another sign of Gus’ extensive, subterranean reach.
MIKE
This is a professional courtesy.
No one knows I’m here. Understand?
Walt nods, numb.
MIKE
But our employer would find out.
Like always. And, if Pinkman were
arrested... he’d take it as a
problem.

Walt, you got a good thing going
here. We all do. You want to risk

Now, I realize you two have a

time comin’.
Walt gets a chill.
WALT
... what is?
The question hangs in the air a moment. Then, in that nononsense, matter-of-fact Mike style, he tells a story:
MIKE
Um... I used to be a beat cop, long
time ago. And I’d get called out
on domestic disputes all the time.
Hundreds, probably, over the years.
But there was this one guy, this
one piece of shit that I will never
forget. Gordie. He looked like Bo
Svenson. You remember him?
“Walking Tall?” You don’t
remember?
WALT

No.
Normally when underworld types come in his home, sit on his
couch and break into storytime, Walt pays attention for about
zero seconds. But it’s hard not listen to Mike here.
MIKE
(nods, continues)
Anyway. Big boy. 270-280. But
his wife, or whatever she was, his
lady, was real small. Like a bird.
Wrists like... little branches.
Anyway, my partner and I’d get
called out there every weekend and
one of us’d pull her aside, and
we’d say “Come on. Tonight’s the
night we press charges.” And this
wasn’t one of those “Deep down he
really loves me” set-ups. We got a
lot of those, but not this. This
girl was scared. She wasn’t gonna
cross him. No way, no how.
Nothin’ we can do but hand her off

But one night my partner’s out
sick. And it’s just me. And the
call comes in and it’s the usual
crap. Broke her nose in the shower
kinda thing. So, I cuff him, put
him in the car and away we go.
Only that night, we’re driving into
town and this sideways asshole is
in my backseat humming “Danny Boy”.
And it just rubbed me wrong. So
instead of left, I go right, out
into nowhere, and I kneel him down
and put my revolver in his mouth,
and I told him: This is it. This
is how it ends. And he’s cryin’,
going to the bathroom all over
himself. Swearing to god he’s
gonna leave her alone. Screaming --
much as you can with a gun in your
mouth. And I told him to be quiet.
I needed to think about what I was
gonna do here. And of course he
got quiet. Goes still and real
quiet. Like a dog waiting for
dinner scraps. And we just stood
there for awhile. Me, acting like
I’m thinkin’ things over, and
Prince Charming kneelin’ in the
dirt with shit in his pants. After
a few minutes, I took the gun out
of his mouth and I say, So help me,
if you ever touch her again, I will
such and such and such and such,

Mike trails off in disgust. Walt’s trying to understand.

It was just a warning?
MIKE
Well, of course. Just trying to do
the right thing.

A BICYCLE WHEEL spins past. The rider is... Tomas. We’re
back where we started in the Teaser. The kid circles nothing
in particular, bored. We might even be reminded of the way
he circled Combo the first time we saw this particular street
corner. No sign of the Bulletheads.

seat Wendy picks nervously at her hair.

So where are they?
WENDY
I dunno. They’re always around.
JESSE
Burgers are getting cold.
Wendy eyes the white fast food bag on her lap. The knowledge
that the burgers are poisoned is freaking her out.
WENDY
So is it like... fast?
Jesse lowers the binoculars and looks over at her. The chunk
of meth Jesse gave her is calling Wendy’s name and she knows
these drug dealers don’t deserve to breathe... Still, she
wants to get it over with before second thoughts set in.

whips around to see a man bending down to peer at him.
It’s Mike. Jesse takes a moment to place him. Then -- OH --
he remembers the PI from the terrible morning after Jane
died. Jesse starts to roll down his window.
MIKE
Gonna need you to come with me.
Before Jesse can protest, VICTOR opens the passenger door and
leans over Wendy.
VICTOR
Take a walk.
Wendy doesn’t need to be asked twice, she rushes to climb
out. The sight of Victor takes the wind out of Jesse’s
sails. If Mike is working with Gus’ minion, Jesse’s deep in
the shit. Off Jesse getting out:

Knowing trouble when she sees it, Wendy hurries away.
Victor’s car (last seen in 304) is parked behind the Tercel.
Mike opens the back door of Victor’s car for Jesse.
Has Walt given Mike the green light to get rid of Jesse? Is
that what “no half measures” means?
There’s no one around to help and no escape. Left with no
recourse, Jesse climbs into Victor’s car. Mike slides in
after him, closing the door with a THUNK.

PANNING ACROSS an abstract swirl of OUT OF FOCUS brown

out about his plans to kill the Bulletheads?
Off Jesse, adrenaline surging, trying to hide his fear...
EXT. FACTORY FARM - DAY
Victor’s car drives our way, raising a trail of dust.
PANNING with the car as it passes the weathered buildings of
GUS’ FACTORY FARM. Jesse doesn’t know this place, but we do.
No activity is visible; the trucks have departed for the day.
It’s the perfect isolated spot for an execution.
EXT. FACTORY FARM - OFFICE TRAILER - DAY
Victor parks next to Gus’ Volvo. Mike climbs out and waits
for Jesse. He gets out cautiously. Nobody has to push or
shove him. Jesse knows better than to resist.
Jesse glances around the strange, deserted place and stops at
the sight of Walt’s Aztek parked nearby. His mind races.
Of course. Walt’s been picked up also. They’re both dead.
Mike curls a finger at Jesse. This way.
Jesse walks toward the trailer, keeping his head up high.
He’s terrified but he’s not begging. The kid’s got spine.

Jesse enters, surprise on his face as he sees...
Men sit around the table, waiting for Jesse’s arrival. It
feels like a cross between a mobster’s sit-down and an
intervention.
Jesse’s POV: Walt’s in the power seat next to GUS. He
avoids Jesse’s glance.

Gus is beside Walt, calmly in control. But Jesse’s gaze
moves past the stranger (remember Jesse’s never met Gus) to

end of the table, biding their time.
Moments ago Jesse was about to poison these assholes. Now
here they are, watching him as if they’ve got all the cards.
GUS
Sit down.
Jesse takes the empty seat in front of him. Victor and Mike
sit nearby, ready in case they’re needed.
Gus begins with quiet authority. He states the case simply
and accurately with an almost judicial detachment.
GUS
I understand that you have a
problem with two of my employees.
Jesse’s putting it together -- this is the guy, the “boss.”
The one he was never allowed to meet. Jesse doesn’t quite
have the nerve to meet Gus’ questioning glance.
GUS
It is true that they killed one of
your associates. It is possible
they acted rashly. But, on the
other hand, there was provocation.
The man was selling on their
territory.
(including the
Bulletheads)
There is blame on both sides.

This will go no further. It will
be settled right here, right now.
But Jesse’s looking at Walt. He can see Walt’s not here
against his will. And if that’s true...
JESSE

You told him?
Walt looks away. Gus narrows his eyes. Is this junkie too
stupid to understand that he’s being presented with a chance
to save his own life? This dirty laundry shouldn’t be aired

stays put, watching everything that goes down.
Once Victor and the Bulletheads are gone, we see a new side
of Gus. His mask of impartiality drops. He despises this
kid, this insect, this junkie troublemaker.
Gus rises and stands over Jesse. He’s quiet, he’s controlled
but this is Gus losing his temper.
GUS
Listen to me. You have one friend
in this room.
(pointing at Walt)
This man.
Walt stays seated --- and silent. The body language makes it
clear; Gus is the boss here. There’s no trace of
“Heisenberg” now; Walt has become a submissive company man.
GUS
Those men outside are my trusted
employees. And when I learned what
you intended to do...
Gus can barely contain his contempt for the cowardice and
stupidity of Jesse’s plan. He lets his words trail off, not
finishing his thought. But his meaning is very clear.
GUS
If it wasn’t for this man -- and
the respect I have for him -- I
would be dealing with this in a
very different way.
Jesse cuts his eyes over to Walt.
GUS
You don’t look at him. You look at
me.
(Jesse complies, then)
This is what happens now. My men
will come back inside. And you
will shake their hands and you will
make peace. And that will be the
end of this.
He doesn’t need to say “or else.” There’s no choice here.
Jesse must knuckle under to survive.
But... something won’t allow him to go along. Something deep
inside him rebels. He returns Gus’ stare. And says simply:

Gus. As scared as he is, Jesse’s not backing down. Even Gus
is surprised by Jesse’s quiet bravery.

They use kids. These assholes of
yours -- they got an eleven year
old kid doing their killing for

You okay with this? You got

Surely Walt is going to stand up to Gus. Now he’s got to
side with Jesse. Heisenberg will be here any second, right?
Wrong. Walt just stares at the table. A gutless wonder.
This is Walt’s most cowardly moment.
Gus stares at Jesse for a long, charged beat. Most likely
he’s deciding the kid is going to be killed -- right now.
GUS

Bring them back.
Mike goes to the door and signals to Victor. Jesse doesn’t

they nod. An order from Gus is not to be questioned.

And you. You keep the peace.
Jesse nods. Not quite believing this outcome.
GUS
Say it.
JESSE
Yeah. I’ll keep the peace.

humiliated. He’s never stood up to Gus like this, never even
imagined it. Off Jesse -- has he just won a victory?

seat. Jesse ignores him, staring out the window.
After Walt’s betrayal, Jesse is through with “Mr. White.”
Whatever respect remained is gone. A long beat. Finally
Walt can’t stand it any more -- he’s got to explain himself.

Translation: I ratted you out to save your life. Walt’s
trying to be mature and fatherly -- but every word rings
hollow.
In Jesse’s eyes, and in his own, he’s lost his balls.
The Aztek slows. Before the car even stops, Jesse throws
open the door and jumps out. He’s had enough of Walt.
EXT. URBAN STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Turns out we’re back where Mike and Victor picked Jesse up.
Jesse charges to his Toyota without bothering to close the
Aztek’s passenger door. Walt rolls his window down, trying
to get one last word in.
WALT
Jesse... Jesse...
THRUMM! Jesse burns rubber as he peels out. With a heavy
sigh, Walt reaches over and pulls the passenger door closed.
NEW ANGLE -- on the Aztek from way up the street. A long
lens compresses the space, in f.g. Tomas circles on his bike.
Now that we’re closer to the kid, we can hear he’s humming a
little tuneless song as he makes his wobbly figure-eights.
(If we haven’t noticed them yet, now we get a good look at
the distinctive, almost garish SNEAKERS on Tomas’ feet.)
No matter how much this boy has seen and done, he’s still
just a kid. Maybe Jesse’s bravery has saved Tomas and some
other kids like him. In the b.g., Walt pulls the Aztek into
a U-turn and heads in the opposite direction that Jesse went.
Off Tomas, quietly humming to himself:
INT. HOSPITAL - HANK’S ROOM - DAY
TIGHT ON water droplets falling from a sponge. RACK to Hank
eyeing Marie as she wrings the sponge into a bowl.
HANK
Marie, let the people who get paid
to do this do this.
Marie pulls the top of the his gown aside and begins to
gently sponge his shoulders and neck. Having Marie touch him
like this just makes Hank feel more helpless.
MARIE
The people who get paid to do this
do a lousy job.

Marie moves more covers and starts on his biceps.
MARIE
(quieter)
So I guess this is what you want,
huh? Just lying in a hospital bed
getting sponge baths from nurses.
HANK
(not this again)
Marie...
MARIE
It’s time to go home, Hank.
HANK
(for the millionth time)
How many times I gotta tell ya,
Marie? Not ‘till I’m well.
Marie sponges in silence for a moment, trying to think of
something to say that’ll change Hank’s mind. But she’s tried
all the words she can think of... Wait a minute.
Marie has an inspiration. Working her way down, she sponges
Hank’s body under the covers and goes lower... and lower...
And lower still... We can’t see exactly what’s going on, but
Hank is mildly alarmed.
HAN
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wha-wha-whawhat’ya you doing?
MARIE
I’m just seeing.
This happens OFF SCREEN but from Hank’s reaction it’s clear
that she’s stroking him where it’ll make the biggest impact.
HANK
Seeing what?
MARIE
Seeing what I see.
HANK
I’m not at my best here, Marie...
MARIE
We’ll see.

Staying TIGHT on Marie as she continues, a twinkle in her
eye. All we can make out is the rhythmic motion of her upper
arm but there’s definitely an expert handjob in progress.
Hank’s more uncomfortable and exasperated by the second.
HANK
Nothing’s gonna happen.
MARIE
I say it will.
HANK
Nah. I’m in this bed for a reason.
(she’s not stopping)
It’s a waste of time. Besides,
what if someone comes in?
MARIE
Let ‘em. I don’t care if someone
walks in.
HANK
Marie, what is wrong with you?
MARIE
I tell you what. If I can get the
groundhog to see his shadow --
HANK
(interrupting)
-- that’s not gonna happen. I’m
sorry.
MARIE
I’m betting it will. And if he
does, you check out of here.
Hank feels self-conscious not to mention pissed. The woman
is taking advantage of his diminished state! However,
judging from the little we can see, Marie really knows what
she’s doing.
But it seems to make no difference to Hank.
HANK
I’m not gonna bet on whether I can
get a boner. There’s no bet, no
bet here! No bet!

What’s the point?
Now Marie goes all in. If she fails, she may never get him
out of this hospital. She looks Hank in the eye.
MARIE
The point is you’re not completely
hopeless. We have a bet?
Hank considers. This is beyond the pale, but...
HANK
You know what? If it’ll get you
outta here quicker, you’ve got one
minute.
MARIE
One minute? Alright. That’s a
cakewalk.
HANK
Yeah. This is just, this is just
sad... I mean, I really feel sorry
for you, Marie, you know, I really
do. It’s just, uh... it’s
pathetic.
The lady doth protest too much, methinks. Marie has him
where she wants him and she knows it.
MARIE
That’s good, keep talking.
Protest. Struggle.
HANK
Marie... Give up... I mean,
seriously. It’s... not... gonna
happen.
A look crosses Hank’s face and he falls silent. Betrayed by
his own dong. Off a glimmer of triumph in Marie’s eyes...
INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY
A SPRAY OF PURPLE FLOWERS sways in front of Hank’s pissed-off

INT. ANDREA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tight on a BEDSIDE RADIO playing soft MUSIC. A plastic
INDIAN is perched on top of the radio, firing his arrow down
at a cowboy on the bedside table. We follow a trail of
injection-molded warriors from the bedside table... across
crumpled pillows to...
Jesse and Andrea. They’re having a quiet moment in bed.
Jesse watches smoke curl from his cigarette, deep in thought.
Andrea gently traces her fingertips over his tattoos. She
knows something’s going on with him.
ANDREA
Bad day?
Jesse thinks it over. All he can come up with is:
JESSE
I don’t even know.
He’s not being evasive, he’s still trying to figure it out.
Jesse’s still shaken by his brush with death. But he’s also
torn between pride in his small victory and disgust at
himself for being part of Gus’ operation.
He glances over at Andrea, a ghost of a smile for her.
JESSE
Anyway. It’s better now.
He leans over and kisses her. She kisses back. Looks like
Jesse really is going to keep the peace. THRRRRRRP! The
moment is interrupted.
Andrea looks over at her bedside phone.
ANDREA
Uggggh.
JESSE
Tell ‘em you’re busy.
The phone is on Jesse’s side of the bed. Andrea crawls over
him. She perches on the side of the bed, back to Jesse, as
she picks up.

ANDREA
Hello... Grandma? Slow down.
Slow down. I can’t -- Oh, God...

...Oh, God.
The mood in the room has suddenly changed. Jesse’s smile
fades: sounds like something terrible has happened. Her
grandmother, breathless and horrified, tries to explain. As
Andrea starts to understand her voice breaks.
ANDREA
Oh my God.
NEW ANGLE -- Jesse and Andrea are framed in the doorway as he
stubs out his cigarette, very worried. A small figure
appears in f.g. -- it’s Brock. He peers curiously up the
hall as his mother cries. Off this heartbreaking image:
EXT. PLAYGROUND CRIME SCENE - NIGHT
Starting with impressionistic, nearly abstract images. BLUE
LIGHTS bob and swirl rhythmically. Muffled VOICES and RADIOS
Doppler and echo as if from very far away.
The lights drift into focus; ROLLERS on top of a pair of
SQUAD CARS. We’re FLOATING THROUGH a crowd of DARK FIGURES,
following someone rushing ahead of us... She glances back --
it’s Andrea. The sound keeps us strangely detached.
Now glimpses of slowly turning chains on a SWING SET and a
silhouetted SEE-SAW tell us we’re in a playground. But it’s
also a crime scene; evidence flags are planted over CHALK
TRIANGLES on the asphalt.
The dreamy POV pushes forward (this could be one of our rare
Steadicam scenes) -- chasing Andrea as she moves in and out
of sight through a tangle of ONLOOKERS and COPS.
We catch up with Andrea. She slows as she arrives at the
quiet center of the action in a SAND-FILLED play area. A
FAMILIAR BICYCLE is upended nearby, wheel slowly turning...
A big-boned COP crouches over a SMALL FIGURE sprawled out on
the sand. A sheet covers the body, but we can make out a
little sneaker-clad FOOT.
Mercifully we don’t see the body but that distinctive, almost
gaudy sneaker leaves no doubt. It’s Tomas, Andrea’s younger
brother, under that sheet. The Bulletheads have taken Gus’
order about “no more kids” very literally.

Andrea cries out in anguish as GRANDMA rushes over to her.
PIVOTING around Tomas’ bike to finally reveal JESSE. We’ve

PUSHING CLOSE on Jesse, the bicycle wheel in f.g.
The sound comes RUSHING IN... the chatter of people, the
squawk of walkie-talkies -- and the keening, heart-shattering
sound of Andrea and her grandmother wailing.
Jesse’s rocked, the world has turned upside down -- he’s not
thinking about who’s responsible, he’s not enraged -- that
will all come later. Right now the sight of Andrea and her
dead brother is his whole universe.
Off Jesse, overcome, the blue rollers flickering across his
face. What is he going to do about this?

Tyvek (minus mask). He checks his watch. He looks annoyed,
for sure, but also a little... concerned.
He crosses to the wall PHONE, dials and gets...
JESSE (VOICEMAIL)
Hey. It’s me. Wait for the thing.
Walt leaves a message. (He’s aware that the lab may be
bugged and that Gus could be listening in, so Walt does his
best to affect an air of controlled professionalism.)
WALT
Jesse, you are now... 42 minutes
late. I’m starting without you.
Walt hangs up, mutters. If Jesse wants to hold a grudge,
screw him. Walt grabs a MASK and pulls it over his face.
We’re HIGH and WIDE and LOOKING DOWN on Walt as he walks over

Skyler’s tossing a salad. Walt walks past, hesitates.
WALT
Uh... okay to use your bathroom,

Okay, now we understand Walt’s need to be diplomatic. He
doesn’t want to give Skyler the impression he’s overreaching
on their new ‘arrangement’. But asking permission to use the
bathroom? Seriously? When the hell is our hero going to
sack up and take command? Where o’ where is Heisenberg?

Paramedics were called to the scene
but were unable to revive the boy.
A gruesome crime.

Walt doesn’t hear her. He’s fixated on the TV screen.

Seriously rattled, Walt joins his family at the dinner table.
Like a truck driver fighting sleep, Walt’s determined to stay
focussed, to stay present. Here, with his family.
Try as he might, Walt’s having an hard time staying engaged.
Brief, natural pause as they eat. Then --

Hey, uh, did you know your Dad and
I are thinking about maybe starting

Walt, Jr. likes the sound of that. Yet another hopeful sign

Walt opens the door and leaves. Off Skyler and Walter, Jr:
exchanging a look. What just happened?
INT. TERCEL - NIGHT
A strange yellow light washes across a pair of hands fumbling
with a tiny plastic bag. The hands shake the contents of the
bag out onto the surface of a scratched-up CD.
The hands use the butt end of a Bic lighter to grind the meth
crystals. Who is this pathetic skell?
We TILT to discover -- Jesse. He’s getting ready to take a
bump of the meth he bought from the Bulletheads in 311.
Jesse stares down at the meth. Of course, he’s not really
going to do this. He’s going to reconsider. But...
Jesse SNORTS THE LINE. When he said that he was through with
drugs he believed it -- and so did we. But now Jesse’s
sobriety, so seriously undertaken, so hard won, is broken.
WOOOSH! Jesse’s head snaps back with the meth rush.
CUTTING WIDER. We’re in Jesse’s parked car. Sodium-vapor
streetlights outside fill the car with an uncanny glow.
Jesse’s breathing gets faster, there’s a wild look in his
eyes. The months away from the drugs make the ride sharper
and stronger than ever.
Headlights from a passing car sweep over Jesse, illuminating
the inside of the car for a moment. He doesn’t want to be
seen. He slumps back in his seat, watchful and resolute.
Why is he hiding in his car, bumping on meth in the dark?

Jesse’s parked about a block away from the Bulletheads’
corner. (He might be in the same spot as in the Teaser or
some other location. Whatever works best for the sequence.)
The street is deserted except for a JUNKIE waiting to buy,
stomping his feet in the cold.
EXT. URBAN STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Angle thorough the windshield PUSHING IN on Jesse. His eyes
glitter in the dark as he waits. There’s some kind of
confrontation brewing... but what has Jesse got in mind?
Another car passes through the wide, desolate street. A beat
and... HERE THEY ARE.
The Bulletheads’ LOWRIDER slides out of the darkness,
headlights off. A predator emerging from perfect camouflage.
The junkie lopes over to the car and leans in, doing a buy.
Without their underage kids, the Bulletheads are getting more
hands-on in their work.
INT. TERCEL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Jesse reaches under his seat and pulls out a STAINLESS STEEL
9MM AUTOMATIC. This is no Saturday night special. Jesse’s
taken a big step up from the revolver he bought last season.
He needs one more thing. Putting the gun aside, he shakes
the rest of the meth out of the tiny baggie, crushes it on
the CD and takes another, even deeper BUMP.
Whooooooooa! Better. He’s feeling the anger he needs for
this. The meth-head’s Dutch courage.
Back to the automatic. Working with focus, Jesse tugs the
slide back and releases it. Click-CLICK. Now there’s a
round in the chamber.
Jesse looks back up at the corner. The junkie finishes his
buy and slinks off. How much longer will the Bulletheads
linger, now that their business is done?
Now or never.
Running on pure rage and blue meth, Jesse takes a deep
breath. No matter what the consequences, he’s going to make
these men pay a price for what they’ve done.
Heart racing, knowing that this may be the last thing he ever
does, Jesse gets out of the car.

EXT. STREETCORNER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
In the lowrider, one of the Bulletheads counts money. The
other one taps him on the shoulder. What’s that?
Bullethead POV: a silhouetted figure approaches without
varying his pace. As he crosses through a pool of yellow
light, Jesse’s face is visible. He’s not sneaking up on
these skells, he going to face off with them man-to-man.
ANGLE LOW behind Jesse. As he passes us, the STEEL AUTOMATIC
glints in his hand. He holds it behind his back, flattened
against his thigh. It’s out of the Bulletheads’ sight -- for
the moment.
ANGLE LOW on the Monte Carlo. The doors swing open and the
Bulletheads step out.
The Bulletheads exchange a glance and then begin slowly
walking together towards Jesse. They keep their hands in
their pockets.
If we haven’t noticed before, now we see one of the
Bulletheads is wearing a pair of OAKLEY SUNGLASSES around his
neck on a lanyard (this will play in the next episode).
ANGLE LOW on Jesse’s feet walking in measured steps over
cracked asphalt.
CLOSE ON Jesse’s 9mm. TRACKING with the gun as it moves
steadily forward. Streetlights glimmer in the steel.
HIGH AND WIDE. The figures slowly converge. Their long,
ruler-straight shadows slant across the desolate street.
Jesse’s only about a half block from the Bulletheads.
ANGLE ON Jesse; he’s breathing like he’s climbing a mountain.
This is it.
Jesse allows his 9mm to come into view.
The Bulletheads pull their own AUTOMATICS.
Jesse raises his gun and --
SCRREEEEEEEEH! Tires squeal nearby. The Bulletheads turn
just a moment too late and --
RRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAR!
HOLY SHIT! A vehicle SCREAMS out of nowhere, PLOUGHING into
the drug dealers! A gut-turning CRUNCH of metal on flesh.

The Bullethead with the Oakleys slides UNDER THE TIRES. The
vehicle actually rises slightly as it CRUSHES his sternum.
The other guy FLIPS over the vehicle’s hood and goes FLYING.
He hits the concrete face-first and lies there, limp.
Jesse is frozen in place. The vehicle is... WALT’S AZTEK.
Walt gets out of the Aztek and quickly scans the area for
witnesses. As far as he can tell, there’s no one out there.
We didn’t see him but during Jesse’s confrontation with the
Bulletheads, Walt was parked nearby, watching from the
darkness. Getting involved wasn’t a calculated move -- if
he’d had time to think about it maybe he wouldn’t have done
it at all.
But when he saw Jesse walking into a gun fight, Walt’s
instincts took over.
Walt glances back -- the guy under the Aztek’s wheels is
twisted at a weird angle. Blood pools around him.
Definitely dead. But... SCRAPE-SCRAPE. What’s this?
The second Bullethead is MOVING. His automatic landed about
ten feet away from him and he’s painfully inching his way
over to it. The danger’s not immediate; at this rate he’ll
be there sometime after the next Summer Olympics.
Walt goes over to the automatic and picks it up.
With tremendous effort, the wounded Bullethead heaves himself
over onto his back. His face is a mess; landing on the
concrete was like rubbing sandpaper on Jell-o.
Walt stares down at him. He knows what he has to do.
Without taking his eyes off Walt, the Bullethead pulls
himself halfway up to a sitting position. The drug dealer’s
mouth is moving, he’s struggling to say something. Maybe
he’s trying to threaten, maybe plead for mercy. No way to
tell, all he can make are saliva bubbles.
Jesse hasn’t budged since Walt arrived. He’s watching, wideeyed. His automatic dangles at his side, forgotten.
No half measures. Walt grasps the Bullethead’s automatic and
stands over the drug dealer. Is he really going to do this?
The Bullethead stares straight at Walt...
ANGLE LOW on Walt -- KRACKKK! The MUZZLE FLASH creates a
towering, larger-than-life shadow on the building behind him.

know the consequences of what just happened.
Walt looks Jesse in the eyes and says one word:
