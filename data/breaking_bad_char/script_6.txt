TEASER
OVER DARKNESS:
SKYLER’S VOICE. SINGING a lullaby. “Hush Little Baby”.
Quiet and sweet. Just like that time back in Ep. 212 when
Walt was listening in on the baby monitor. (Actually, it's
the very same moment we’re hearing now.) Then --
UP ON:
A series of MICROSCOPIC CLOSE-UPS of:
-- surfaces and contours reflecting light to show intricate,
geometric patterns
-- strange textures that shudder, sway or glisten
-- sudden pulsations of MOVEMENT -- flutter-flutter
Weird -- what are these images? We can’t tell. We’re simply
TOO CLOSE to see. But there’s something arresting and alien
and kind of... beautiful about them.
The lullaby continues as we ADJUST and PULL BACK a bit. Just
enough to reveal: the common HOUSEFLY. We’ve been moving
through a progression of high-definition close ups.
(Note: we've already found footage that we like, and are
hoping we can purchase it as STOCK.)
Now that we know what we’re seeing, these images aren’t
quite so beautiful. They’re actually creepy and disgusting.
The protruding, spongy mouthparts... the pixillated, compound
eyes... the vein structure of the transparent wings... the
delicate, hairy tendrils of the antennae...
Monstrous.
Why are we looking at this? What does this mean? We’ve no
idea, but Skyler’s soothing melody accompaniment only
heightens the now nightmarish quality of our opening.
When her brief lullaby ends we simply ROLL CREDITS and begin
a “Breaking Bad” episode unlike any other.
END TEASER
ACT ONE
A RED, GLOWING LIGHT
Fills frame. It BLINKS OFF. Darkness. After a beat, it
blinks back ON. Pop WIDER to reveal we’re looking up at...
The blinking LED LIGHT of a ceiling SMOKE DETECTOR. Turns
out we are in the POV of...
INT. WALT’S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT
WALT. He lies in bed, staring up at the blinking light.
He’s deep in the disquiet of a sleepless night. On... off...
on... off...
LOCKED-DOWN DISSOLVE from this wakeful 2 a.m. scenario to:
INT. WALT’S CONDO - BEDROOM - MORNING
6 a.m. Dawn light creeps in, as faded and weak as Walt. He
sits slumped on the edge of the bed, weary and careworn, lost
in thought. He’s been sitting here awhile, having given up
on any chance of slumber hours ago.
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep...
His bedside ALARM ruptures the silence. This doesn’t
surprise him -- he’s been waiting out the clock. He simply
reaches out a hand and shuts it off.
CLOSE ON WALT, distinctly troubled. The bedroom might be
silent... but if only he could somehow block out the
relentless din in his head.
What’s on Walt’s mind? Any one of a dozen things could be
plaguing him. Or all of them. Walt’s share of guilt for
Hank getting shot certainly springs to mind.
At any rate, this is the central question of our episode:
What’s the matter with Walt?
He reaches for his GLASSES, puts them on -- though perhaps
he’d prefer the world to remain out of focus.
Off Walt, exhausted and perturbed, facing the day:
EXT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - MORNING
Bright searing sunlight. The sky almost painfully blue.
BREAKING BAD #310 "Fly" AS BROADCAST 2.
(CONTINUED)
WIDE on the facility as several cars enter. Walt’s Aztek is
already parked here.
We discover Walt sitting in his car. He still wears his SEAT
BELT. He’s unmoving, preoccupied, staring straight ahead.
But his tired eyes view only the past, not the present.
JESSE pulls up and parks his Tercel nearby. Jesse climbs
out, takes a last drag of a cigarette -- savoring this last
taste of the free world before entering the dungeon of the
lab. He drops the butt, grinds it out.
He ambles to the Aztek and peers in, then RAPS on our window.
Walt startles a little. He grabs his brown bag lunch from
the passenger seat. He tries to exit but gets SNAGGED by his
seat belt -- didn’t realize it was still fastened.
Chagrined, he unbuckles it.
Walt and Jesse join silent WORKERS entering the laundry.
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - MORNING
CHUNK-CHUNK. Walt and Jesse pass expressionless men and
women standing in line, some holding bag lunches like Walt’s.
These folks dutifully punch in on the laundry’s TIME CLOCK.
CHUNK-CHUNK. On the move, Jesse observes with bitterness.
JESSE
Surprised he doesn’t make us do
that.
Walt glances over, his expression inscrutable. Wordlessly,
he disappears around the corner. Jesse follows on his heels.
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
SH-SH-SH-SH. SOUNDS of SCRUBBING and the occasional GRUNT.
But as we TRACK the rows of equipment, the lab appears to be
empty. WIDE on the entire place -- DESERTED. That is, until
Walt stands up inside a giant VAT, revealing himself.
An OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals Walt and Jesse, wearing full
WATERPROOF GEAR, each cleaning out a separate tank. They
look like sailors on a whaling ship. It’s hard, boring scutwork, but it needs to be done before each new cook.
JESSE
The pack totally has a pecking
order.

(CONTINUED)
SH-SH-SH-SH-SH. Jesse scrubs unenthusiastically with a
BRUSH, speaking intermittently during the small pauses when
he stops. Just talking out loud, whatever’s on his mind.
Walt works diligently, intently -- even in his fatigued state
he finds the chore, and its results, satisfying. He’s not
conversing with Jesse. Not even listening, in fact.
JESSE
And the head hyena, he’s the MAN,
you know. All the other ones have
to like, kiss his ass.
SH-SH-SH-SH-SH.
JESSE
I mean, literally. It’s-it’s so
gross. They have to LICK his JUNK.
I-I-I can’t believe they even
showed it on TV.
SH-SH-SH-SH-SH.
Walt clambers out of his vat and starts cleaning the outside.
From this position he can see GALE’S COFFEE CONTRAPTION.
Walt stares for a moment, then averts his gaze. Refocuses.
Jesse stands up into view, working his shoulder and cracking
his aching neck. Sourly glancing around the lab:
JESSE
Yo, if this is s’posed to be all,
like, Major League and all, we
should have Equipment Maintainer
Guys --
He sinks back down out of sight, keeps scrubbing. SH-SH-SH.
JESSE
-- and Water Boys, you know?
(example)
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.
SH-SH-SH-SH-SH.
JESSE
Get us a couple of flunkies in
here. Treat us right.
Walt moves on to another vessel and gets started. We begin a
SEQUENCE of WIDE, LOCKED-DOWN DISSOLVES of the two of them
cleaning all the equipment. A few examples:

CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
-- Walt hoses down the inside of a tank. Water sluices and
churns within the curved walls.
-- Jesse shoots compressed air through hoses in short bursts.
-- In the triple sink, Walt washes glassware in one sink full
of suds. Rinses in the adjacent sink. Sets each item to dry
in the third one. His own little assembly line.
-- Jesse climbs a ladder to clean inside a Settling Tank.
END SEQUENCE.
INT. SUPERLAB - AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON a white sheet of hand-written NUMBERS (not calculus
formulae, but simply long columns of addition). The tip of a
Number 2 pencil enters frame, scanning down their length.
It’s hours later. The end of a very long day. Walt, now
dressed in street clothes, frowns as he re-checks his math.
He sits at the WEIGHING/PACKAGING bench with PAPERWORK spread
before him (NO meth here). A mug of untouched coffee goes
cold. He’s absorbed in his task -- the numbers perplex him.
Behind him, a cook is finally up and running, as we can tell
by the SOUND EFFECTS, and maybe a bit of STEAM.
Jesse, his Tyvek half off with the sleeves tied around his
waist, checks a few dials. He’s satisfied by what he sees.
He sets a COOK TIMER (one of those palm-size digital deals).
He sticks it to the vat with a magnetic CLUNK, presses START.
JESSE
Okay. 15 hours starts... now.
(done for the day)
I’m gonna hit it if that’s cool
with you.
Walt, engrossed, doesn’t answer. Jesse shakes his head --
what’s up with him today? He crosses to the break room.
Walt studies his figures, pressing his pencil to his lips.
WALT
(muttering)
I don’t understand.
Jesse is visible in the Break Room, shrugging out of his
Tyvek and gathering his stuff.

JESSE
What?
WALT
These numbers. They just don’t add
up.
JESSE
Told ya. Dude’s totally boning us.
WAL
Nah... it’s not that. It’s our
output. We’re off. We’re point
one-four percent off.
Jesse pulls on his hoodie or somesuch, unconcerned.
JESSE
Point one-four, that’s like..?
What does that --
WALT
-- It means, we should be netting
more than we’re netting.
JESSE
(glimmer of interest now)
So how far off are we?
WALT
It’s not negligible. Ball-parking
it, I’d say we’re a quarter to a
half pound shy.
Shit. These are the amounts Jesse’s been stealing. Busted?
Damn Mr. White and his big-ass brain! Luckily for Jesse,
Walt isn’t looking at him or he’d have seen a quick flash of
fear cross his face before Jesse composes himself.
JESSE
That’s weird.
(a beat)
Well, what about spillage.
Walt looks up from his numbers for the first time.
WALT
Spillage?
JESSE
Yeah, you know. Just stuff gets
spilled.
BREAKING BAD #310 "Fly" AS BROADCAST 6.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
WALT
Nothing gets spilled.
JESSE
Little, maybe.
WALT
(stubbornly)
Nothing gets spilled.
JESSE
What about, um, evaporation?
WALT
That wouldn’t account for this
much. The materials aren’t out
that long.
JESSE
What about the, uh, the other one?
The drops. Like on, um, on cold
beer.
WALT
(faintly annoyed)
Condensation?
JESSE
Yeah.
WALT
No.
JESSE
What about the crap that gets left
behind?
(off Walt’s puzzled look)
You know -- all the gunk we scrape
out of the vats. They add up like
a gallon. Each. Didja work that
in?
WALT
(considering)
Vestiges?
JESSE
Yeah. Vestiges.
Walt stares at Jesse for a beat. Blinks. Cocks his head,
birdlike. Returns to his numbers.
Jesse’s uncomfortable. Hopes he dodged that bullet. Now he
just wants to get the hell out of there.

(CONTINUED)
JESSE
Bet that’s it.
(halfway to the stairs)
Bet that’s totally it.
Walt is engrossed in his calculations. Jesse starts up the
spiral staircase, then stops. Some instinct nags at him.
JESSE
Hey, Mr. White.
(no response, louder)
Mr. White.
WALT
Huh?
JESSE
Are you okay?
WALT
Yeah-yeah. Why?
JESSE
... Nothing.
(beat, then)
Are you coming?
WALT
(preoccupied)
Yeah. In a minute.
Jesse nods. He jogs up the spiral staircase, crosses the
catwalk, opens the door and pauses. Looks down at Mr. White.
JESSE’S POV FROM ABOVE. Walt sits hunched over his note pad.
He looks small, shrunken and diminished. With his pencil and
Wallabies, Walt looks like a relic -- incongruous with the
gleaming enormity of the modern lab.
JESSE
Alright, see ya tomorrow.
Without looking up, Walt gives a little wave. Jesse goes.
The heavy door CLANGS shut behind him. Walt is left alone.
Walt re-re-checks his math. It’s still not making sense for
him. Silence while he struggles with it. Then...
... A FAINT BUZZ fades in, then out. Maybe we notice.
Tighter on Walt as he scribbles numbers. A beat. We HEAR
the BUZZ again, a bit louder... this time moving past Walt’s
head in our wonderful Dolby Surround. Walt lifts his eyes,
listens. More silence. He focuses once more on his task.
BREAKING BAD #310 "Fly" AS BROADCAST 8.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
BUZZ-Z. Louder now. Right past Walt’s ear! His head rises.
He glances around left and right above him. What the hell?
Just then, a FLY buzzes into view. It lands on the numberscribbled SHEET before Walt. His eyes narrow on it.
CLOSE ON this fat, black HOUSEFLY. Well-fed. Positively
burly. Wings twitching, it grooms itself.
Walt squints at this insouciant intruder. A fly. In here?!
Unacceptable. He’ll dispatch this pest posthaste.
Slow-ly, slow-ly, Walt reaches for a nearby note pad, raises
it. Eyes on his prey. He slaps the pad down hard -- WHACK!
Fat chance. Unscathed, the fly buzzes off, circles and lands
a few feet away on the adjacent COUNTER.
Still sitting, Walt readies, then LUNGES for it -- the wheels
on his chair ROLL with his momentum -- and SWATS again with
his note pad. WHACK! The metal surface RINGS.
As Walt optimistically lifts up the pad and peers underneath,
the fly BUZZES past. Missed again.
WIDE now. Thus begins a FLY-STALKING SEQUENCE. Walt follows
the fly and swats it at every spot it alights.
Gradually quickening his pace... moving faster and faster...
... Walt soon grows heedless to everything but his pursuit
and his deepening vendetta. In other words, his chase amps
up as he follows this fly around the lab.
THWACK! Miss. THWACK! Miss. THWACK! Miss.
Eventually, he comes to a stop, breathing hard. Mad as hell.
WALT
Bastard.
He really wants to kill this pest. To Walt, this insect is
an insult. An affront. And Walt WILL defeat it.
WALT
Sonofa --
One last missed swing -- then his eyes follow the fly UPWARDS
as it buzzes toward the ceiling.
WALT
Damn it! Come on! Come on, come
on.

(CONTINUED)
ANGLE -- we see it up there. It has alighted on the ceiling
next to one of many bell-shaped LIGHT FIXTURES 25 feet above.
ANGLE FROM ABOVE (FLY POV) -- Walt stands small far below,
breathing hard, looking up, his gaze fixed our way.
Walt does the only logical thing. Logical if you’re Walter
White and determined to control ONE goddamned thing in your
miserable, disintegrating life. Without taking his eyes off
the fly, Walt removes one of his Wallabies. Taking careful
aim... Walt LOBS the shoe straight UP AT US.
The shoe HITS us, MISSES the fly, and falls back uselessly to
the floor with a THUD. Bounces a little.
Walt, disappointed but resolute, retrieves his shoe and tries
again. Windmilling it around underhanded once, twice...
WALT
Son of a bitch.
ANGLE FROM ABOVE as the shoe flies up toward us. The brown
suede grenade soaring up, up, spinning closer, closer...
Fly unharmed, the shoe drops back with an ego-bruising THUD.
Walt’s frustration is palpable. He’s officially seething
with impotent rage. That fucking fly! It hasn’t moved.
Hasn’t even flinched. It’s just sitting there, mocking us.
Walt picks up his shoe. Third time’s the charm, he can feel
it. He HURLS it hard with a grunt and --
-- SMASH! The LIGHT BULB in the nearby fixture SHATTERS as
the shoe impacts it! GLASS SHARDS RAIN DOWN on Walt.
He ducks and covers, runs out of the way. He’s unhurt.
From his new vantage point, Walt looks up to see:
The fixture swings back and forth, back and forth. And his
shoe... is ATTACHED to it! Somehow the shoe lace or somesuch
has managed to get caught on the bottom of the fixture and
now the shoe DANGLES there. Stuck. The fly..? It’s MIA.
WALT
That’s great.
Walt shakes his head. Snorts. Calms down. After a moment,
maybe he even manages to chuckle a little. What folly. This
accident has shaken him loose of his fixation. Jarred some
sense into him. He’s feeling a little foolish now. What the
hell was I thinking? Time to stop this nonsense.
BREAKING BAD #310 "Fly" AS BROADCAST 10.
CONTINUED: (5)
(CONTINUED)
Walt grabs a BROOM from the CLEANING CART. With one shoe on
and one shoe off he walks with a slight limp. Walter White
definitely came out the loser in this battle. Ah well.
He approaches the section of the floor where the broken glass
lies in a glittery mess. Gives it a couple of swift sweeps.
Wait a minute. He’d better retrieve his dangling shoe first.
For safety, to avoid cutting his stocking foot.
Taking the broom, he mounts the stairs and tromps up, one
footfall CLANGING on the metal staircase, one silent.
ON THE CATWALK, Walt leans against the RAILING and reaches
out and over it with the broom to try to knock his shoe free.
He can’t... quite... reach it.
Ever tenacious, he climbs OVER the railing to get a bit
closer. Bad idea -- this can’t be wise. Walt holds onto the
railing with one hand, leans wa-a-y out over the lab as he
wields the broom like a sword. Poke. Poke. Grunt. Poke.
Success! The shoe dislodges and falls to the ground below.
Walt’s relieved, (we’re relieved), and he’s kinda pleased
with himself. Good job. Just then, out of nowhere...
... the FLY buzzes right past his face. Walt’s ire flares.
Even though he’s still on the outside of the railing, he
takes a WILD SWING at the fly with the broom. Miss.
The fly lands on the railing six feet away.
WALT
Bastard.
Walt, all concern for his safety, all reason cast aside in
the face of this new taunt, fixates on his tormentor. He
winds back, swings and SMASHES the broom down on the railing.
CLANG! The entire railing VIBRATES. The momentum of his
swing plus the impact causes the broom to bounce up, flinging
his arm... AH!
Losing his grip and his balance, Walt flails and... FALLS.
CRASH! Walt hits a tall METAL VESSEL on the way down. It
breaks his fall, but doesn’t stop it. He bounces off,
falling to the ground...
... WHUMP! Walt lands hard. The broom CLATTERS next to him.
Both lay silent. Oh, shit. Is Walt dead?
BREAKING BAD #310 "Fly" AS BROADCAST 11.
CONTINUED: (6)
(CONTINUED)
No. He doesn’t move for a moment... but Walt’s not hurt.
Well, not seriously, anyway. Getting his wind back and
groaning, he rolls onto his back. His EYEGLASSES are askew.
WALT’S POV -- as the world returns to focus, something DARK
flits into his vision, coming in for a landing on our lens.
CLOSE ON Walt’s glasses. The fly lands on one of his LENSES
and sits there, nonchalantly preening its legs.
Walt’s eyes widen, then narrow. Unbelievable. Off this
insult to injury, we:

ACT TWO
OVER BLACK:
CHUNK-CHUNK. Up on:
CLOSE -- the TIME CLOCK punches a card. It reads 8:58am.
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - MORNING
Another morning at the laundromat. The SAME expressionless
laundry EMPLOYEES waiting in line to punch their time cards.
CHUNK-CHUNK. CHUNK-CHUNK.
We RACK past them to the open laundry ENTRANCE where Jesse is
pulling into his parking spot. Walt’s empty car is parked
nearby (right where it was the day before).
INT. TERCEL - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
Jesse kills the engine, glancing over at the Aztek. Looks
like eager-beaver company man Walt is already here. Great.
But Jesse’s in no hurry. He’s made it clear: big payday or
no, this job ranks right up there with sushi and coal mining.
No, he’s gonna take his sweet time and finish his cigarette.
After a puff, maybe two, he stubs out his smoke in the car’s
ashtray. The tray is overflowing with butts... and yet ONE
catches his eye. He picks it up and examines the filter.
CLOSE -- RED LIPSTICK SMUDGES. From Jane’s mouth. Her lips.
From Before.
Jesse sits here a moment, a sad silence filling the car.
Then he simply... carefully... places her cigarette butt back
in the ashtray, gets out of the car and heads inside.
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - BASEMENT LANDING - MORNING
The small length of HALLWAY outside the superlab ENTRY DOOR.
Jesse comes down the stairs from the laundry above. He pulls
out his keys, unlocks and pushes open the door -- or at least
tries to. The door opens a bit, then closes shut. Huh?
Jesse peers through the lab door WINDOW, trying to see what
could be blocking the entryway when... he feels the hair atop
his head FLUTTER... like it would in a breeze.
BREAKING BAD #310 "Fly" AS BROADCAST 13.
(CONTINUED)
He looks down at his pant legs... they’re FLAPPING from a
WIND coming through the door cracks. Weird.
Jesse puts his shoulder to the door, straining. He’s finally
able to PUSH IT OPEN and step out onto...
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
... The catwalk. Stumped, he stands here looking around as:
WALT (O.S.)
SHUT THE DOOR!
Here comes Walt, racing upstairs. He’s in his clothes from
yesterday and has a small BANDAGE on one side of his head.
JESSE
My ears are popping.
WALT
SHUT THE DOOR -- !
(annoyed)
Move.
Walt pushes him aside and SLAMS the door shut.
JESSE
It’s like I’m on an airplane, yo.
What the hell’s doing that?!
WALT
Positive pressure.
As he mutters this, Walt kneels down and quickly re-stuffs
the RAGS and TYVEK he’d positioned around the door cracks.
JESSE
Positive what?
(fingers to his ears)
AHH! God, this frickin’ KILLS, yo!
WALT
Just move your jaw around. Move it
around.
JESSE
I am moving it around, alright!
It’s not working!
WALT
Jesus. YAWN or something. Stop
acting like such a baby.

(CONTINUED)
Jesse finally gets his ears to “pop.”
JESSE
Ah. Damn.
(then)
Wh-wh-what “positive?” “Positive
what?”
Walt locks the door and double checks it.
WALT
Pressure. I’ve turned the
ventilation up to keep the outside
out.
(vague; self-conscious)
There’s, uh, been a contamination.
(Note: as we’ve hinted at earlier in the season and in Act
One, Walt has O.C.D. tendencies. Only now, his “tendencies”
have blown up into an “obsession.” This doesn’t mean Walt is
delusional or “crazy” here, he’s still himself -- just
crankier, more anxious, more self-conscious and distracted.)
With that, Walt simply heads off back down the stairs.
JESSE
Wait... WHAT?
Alarmed, Jesse hurries after him.
JESSE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up!
WALT
Something got into the lab.
Walt moves out onto the lab floor with Jesse right behind.
JESSE
So, uh, what do we do? I mean, do
we -- wait, wait -- I mean,
shouldn’t we be wearing MASKS?
WALT
(reluctant)
No, no it’s not that-that kind of
contaminant.
JESSE
So it’s, like, not dangerous?
(needs way more facts)
Mr. White? Talk to me here!

(CONTINUED)
WALT
Not... to us. Particularly. No.
Walt picks up a 3’ long THING made out of duct tape and
cellophane. It looks like a half-assed cross between a sword
and a giant salad spoon. With it in hand, he squints up at
the ceiling. Jesse frowns at the duct tape thingie.
JESSE
What the hell is that?
WALT
(again, vague)
This is, uh... I made it.
JESSE
... So, exactly what kind of
contaminant are we dealing with
here?
Walt sighs. He’s fully aware of how this is going to sound
to Jesse, but... let’s just get it over with:
WALT
A fly.
Walt moves away, searching the heavens. Jesse puzzles.
JESSE
What do you mean? A fly like...
like what do you mean?
WALT
I mean a fly. A housefly.
Jesse stands here, blinking. Trying to understand.
JESSE
Like, uh... one fly? Singular?
(off Walt’s nod)
What’d it DO?
WALT
It... got into the lab! And I’m
trying to get it OUT. Okay?
Understand?
Walt moves off again, resuming his fly search.
JESSE
No, man. Not really. I can’t say
as I’m really following you here.
(now erupts)
Dude, you scared the SHIT outta me!

(CONTINUED)
You say “contamination,” I mean,
I’m thinking, like, a, like, ebola
leak or something!
WALT
(derisive)
“Ebola?”
JESSE
It’s a disease on The Discovery
Channel where all your intestines
just sorta slip right outta your
butt.
WALT
Thank you, I know what Ebola is.
Now tell me -- what would a West
African virus be doing in our lab,
hmm?
JESSE
(a perfect dry beat)
So... you’re chasing around a fly,
and in your world I’m the idiot.
Walt rubs his eyes. This is the EXACT reaction from Jesse he
was dreading. But maybe he can get the kid to understand.
WALT
Jesse, this-this fly --
(rephrasing)
-- ANY fly -- cannot be in our lab.
It’s... it’s a problem. It’s a
contamination, and that is in no
way a misuse of the word. Okay?
So, in terms of keeping our cook
clean and our product
unadulterated... we need to take
this very seriously. Now, do you
understand?
Jesse looks down at Walt’s cellophane sword thing.
JESSE
So, is that your fly saber?
WALT
(self-conscious)
This is a swatter. And it happens
to work quite well, thank you.
JESSE
Uh-huh.

(CONTINUED)
Hey, uh, what happened to your-your
head?
WALT
Nothing. I’m fine.
JESSE
You didn’t hit it?
(serious)
Like really, really hard?
WALT
(losing patience)
My head is not the problem, Jesse.
The fly is the problem.
JESSE
(dead serious)
You didn’t happen to maybe try our
product, did you?
Walt scratches his neck. This is like trying to teach jazz
to a chimp. But again, he checks his anger and explains:
WALT
Jesse, I know this seems unusual to
you, a layman. A fly? I get it.
Seems insignificant, right? But
trust me: in a highly controlled
environment such as this, any
pollutant, no matter how small,
could completely...
Walt simply trails off as if he’d finished his thought, then
walks to the finishing tank and looks around and above it.
Jesse stands here hanging, bewildered.
JESSE
Hello?
WALT
What?
Jesse finally takes in Walt’s appearance: the stubble, the
red-rimmed eyes, the rumpled (and familiar) clothes.
JESSE
Were you here all night?
(then)
Have you even slept?
WALT
Jesse, look, I’m fine. So why
don’t you just please focus on --

Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep. It’s the
TIMER attached to the giant MIX/COOK VESSEL.
Walt steps over and turns it off. Time to assume control.
WALT
Okay, look. We’re running late, so
let’s just get started, shall we?
The sooner we do it, the sooner
we’re done.
JESSE
(mutters)
Frickin’ finally.
(Note: as we all know, these super cooks take place over a
couple of days. They’re about halfway through the process
here, with 2-3 more significant steps remaining.)
Jesse trudges a few feet to the storage shelves, grabs a SACK
of SODIUM HYDROXIDE and crosses to the MIX/COOK TANK.
WALT

you doing?
JESSE
(re: the sack)
It’s time to alkaline.
WALT
Have you not heard a word I said?
NO COOKING until this fly is dealt
with.
(off Jesse’s disbelief)
Have I been speaking to MYSELF?
JESSE
The timer went off, yo! How long
is this batch gonna be good for?
An hour? Two?
WALT
The batch will be good for nothing
if we don’t clear the contaminant!
JESSE
“Clear the contaminant?!” We’re
making METH here, alright, not
SPACE SHUTTLES!
WALT
We’re making NOTHING until we catch
this fly!

JESSE
WHAT fly?! Alright, where the hell
IS this fly? Not like I even seen
this thing! Maybe your “positive
pressure” blew it out the door or
something!
WAL
No, no, it is HERE. It is around,
okay? He’s around. And I am not
going to expose this batch to the
open air and contamination.
Period. Now, you can leave me to
deal with this myself, or you can
help me. But you’re right -- we
are running out of time, so I need
your answer right NOW.
Jesse’s BAFFLED. They’re gonna risk losing a fortune in
drugs over a fly?! Still, when it comes to Walt, he knows
the path of least resistance is almost always submission.
Jesse DROPS the sack. Let’s fucking get this over with.
WALT
Okay.
TIME CUT TO:
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING - LATER
One minute later? Five? Time seems to stand still down here
in this windowless prison. Walt moves slowly, searching
everywhere. Deliberate and methodical. Over on the other
side of the facility, Jesse is dragging ass, his newspaper
hanging limply from the end of his arm.
Jesse doesn’t give a flying fuck about this fly -- provided
it’s still here or even exists in the first place. He’s
worried about the cook they’re going to lose. He’s keeping a
subtle eye on distant Walt, glancing at him as he moves in
and out of view across the way.
Jesse is bewildered and annoyed by his mentor, to be sure...
but add to that he’s growing more and more concerned about
Walt’s state of mind.
Jesse checks his watch. Holds it up and taps it with a
finger for Walt to see.
JESSE
Hey. Tick-tock, yo.

Walt does his best to disregard this pressing fact. As they
both slowly wander, gradually circulating around the lab,
Jesse tries a different tack.
JESSE
Look, I like making cherry product,
but let’s keep it real, alright:
we make POISON for people who DON’T
CARE. Alright? We probably have
the most UN-PICKY customers in the
world.
WALT
(rallying)
No-no-no. No... rationalizing.
We’ll find it any minute. Don’t
give up.
Jesse watches as Walt moves away. Something is DEFINITELY
SKETCHY with Mr. White today. Maybe it’s just your typical
no-sleep jittery weirdness, but... strange.
It’s now that Jesse notices his little tour around the room
has brought him back to the mix/cook tank. He looks around:
Walt’s wandered off, OUT OF SIGHT.
Screw this. Jesse tucks the crossword section in his back
pocket and begins to quickly unscrew the tank lid FASTENINGS.
(We’re not sure there is anything like this, but we want to
give Jesse a bit of business before he can open the tank.)
JESSE
(covering; conversational)
Did you, uh, did you know there’s,
uh, an acceptable level of rat
turds that can go into candy bars?
That’s the Government, Jack! Even
the Government doesn’t care that
much about quality.
The lid is unlatched. Jesse bends down, reaching for the bag
of sodium hydroxide at his feet.
JESSE
Know what is okay to put in hot
dogs, huh? Pig lips and assholes.
I say have at it, bitches -- ‘cause
I love hot dogs! And uh, you know,
see what I’m -- ?
Suddenly, like in a horror film, Walt APPEARS! Looking at
Jesse through a gap between vessels (or somesuch).

WALT
What are you doing?
JESSE
(regains his composure)
Oh, hey. Lemme just top it off,
alright, really quick. You know, a
little sodium hydroxide, shut the
lid -- no harm done. Then we’re
golden.
Walt stares, not blinking... so Jesse risks it. He reaches
to lift the lid. But the second he opens it a fraction of an
inch -- Walt reaches out and SLAMS it shut again.
WALT
It stays closed. That’s an ORDER.
JESSE
You can’t “order” shit, Adolf,
alright? We’re 50/50 partners,
remember?
Jesse tries once more to open the vessel -- and Walt, without
hesitation, SWINGS his swatter hard against Jesse’s shoulder.
JESSE
OWWW! GAH -- what is your PROBLEM?
Jesse grabs his shoulder. That really hurt! Recovering,
Jesse RUSHES Walt. They GRAPPLE in typical awkward white boy
fashion. Finally, Jesse is able to SHOVE Walt back.
Jesse stands growling and rubbing his shoulder in pain.
JESSE
Frickin’ PSYCHO! AHH!
WALT (O.S.)
Jesse.
JESSE
Like, hit bone.
WALT (O.S.)
(low, insistent)
Jesse. Jesse.
Jesse glances at Walt, double-takes. His pissed expression
fades a little as he stands staring at...
... The FLY. It has come to rest on Walt’s bald HEAD! Walt
stands frozen, afraid to move. Terrified to lose it again.

For Jesse, this is one of those rare, slow-dawning moments
that’s just too good to be true. Sly, yet deadpan...
JESSE
You want me to get it?
WALT
Yes. Slow! Move slowly...
JESSE
I know. I’m moving slowly. Yeah.
Absolutely. I’m just gonna need
your “swatter” thing... Come on.
Oh yeah. It’s okay... come on.
Jesse slowly withdraws the big FLY SABER from Walt’s hand.
WALT
Make it count.
JESSE
Yeah, no, no. I’m gonna, I’m gonna
make it count alright.
Jesse carefully RAISES it high. Yeah, he’s enjoying this.
Walt, eyes focused upward and standing motionless as a
statue, is too preoccupied to notice.
WALT
Okay. Now, on three.
JESSE
Okay.
WALT
On-nne...
BAM! On his own timetable, Jesse SLAMS the big fly swatter
down on Walt’s head!

JESSE
You like that? Hurts, huh?
After a second to recover, his hand to his head, Walt checks
his palm for fly guts. Finds none. Scanning the floor:
WALT
Did you get it? --
JESSE
(not lying)
I think so, yeah.
Walt checks the swatter. There’s no fly corpse, no smudge
(no insert needed here -- our actor’s reaction will suffice).
WALT
Where is it?
JESSE
I don’t know. What’s it matter?
Who cares? I got it.
(Walt drops to his knees)
Ah, Jesus. Seriously..?
WALT
Where is it?
They search. Walt on all fours, Jesse standing. Soon:
JESSE
It’s, uh... oh! Right there.
Look. Look!
He points at a tiny, dark brown SPLAT that rests just under
the edge of the tank, or perhaps in one of the nooks of a
Sorbothane floormat. In other words, easy to miss.
JESSE
See? I told you I got it.
Walt picks it up.
WALT
This is a raisin.
JESSE
Look, I definitely got it, man,
alright...
Bzzz-z. The FLY passes just overhead, right between them.
Walt slow-burns. The air leaks out of Jesse, as he truly did
think he killed it. He stares after the fly.

(CONTINUED)
JESSE
Ah, man.
(sheepish shrug)
He’s got some skills, yo. I’ll
give him that.
Walt rubs his head with his hand, trying to master his
emotions. He rises to his feet, faces Jesse. Outwardly
quiet and calm... yet hinting at the roiling ANXIETY within:
WALT
Look. I feel like I’m running out
of ways to explain this to you...
but once more, I will try. This
fly is a major problem for us. It
will ruin our batch. And we need
to destroy it and every trace of it
so we can cook. Failing that?
We’re dead. There is no more room
for error. Not with these people.
Finally, there’s a hint of true CRAZINESS here. Not much...
just a tad. Right now, it seems born of FEAR.
For Jesse, this is where the penny drops. Mr. White is not
just being over-tired and douche-y this morning. Jesse comes
to decide that the man has truly lost it.
Jesse considers him a beat. Nodding, speaking nonchalantly:
JESSE
How ‘bout we go get some air?
WALT
“Get some air?” Your answer to
“We’re sliding head-first into a
massive crap...”
JESSE
Mr. White, I understand that the
fly is a serious thing now,
alright. I’m onboard. I’m just
saying, you know, maybe if we went
and got some air, it would help us
come up with a plan on how to catch
it. Then come back down here and
subtract his ass.
Walt considers. A beat, then he sighs and nods, giving in.
Jesse smiles, relaxing a little. This is good. Good sign.
Jesse holds out an arm, offering “after you.” He follows
Walt as they both mount the spiral staircase and climb it to
the catwalk above.

UP ON THE CATWALK, Walt moves wearily. He seems exhausted.
As they reach the door, he muscles it open against the breezy
AIRFLOW... then pauses, turning to Jesse.
WALT
Oh wait. D’you have your keys?
JESSE
Yeah.
WALT
You sure? Last thing we need is to
get locked out.
JESSE
Yeah.
True that. Good-naturedly, Jesse fishes his KEYS from his
pocket and jingles them in two fingers -- See? All good.
In a flash, Walt SNATCHES the keys, SHOVES Jesse out the door
and locks him out! Looks like Walt had a plan, too.
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - BASEMENT LANDING - CONTINUOUS
Jesse didn’t see it coming. Before he can turn around and
push back -- CLICK! -- the door is LATCHED tight. He stands
here stunned, peering at Walt through the door’s tiny window.
JESSE
HEY!
WALT
(muffled through glass)
If you’re not going to help, STAY
OUT OF MY WAY!
Walt turns and disappears. Off to battle the fly on his own.
JESSE
Hey!
Jesse POUNDS the steel door a couple times. Futile. What
now? He’s not eager to lose an entire cook -- but he’s also,
god help him, concerned for Walt’s health.
Off Jesse, running up the stairs, out of sight:

Lots of STEAM and hot, HISSING equipment -- WOMEN and MEN
work hard on the ironing side of this operation. Into frame
jogs near-frantic Jesse. He heads for the nearest WORKER.
JESSE
Yo, does somebody got an axe I can
use?
The Worker glances at him blankly. Jesse opens up his
questioning to the group. He mimes CHOPPING with both hands.
JESSE
El axe-o! Peligroso! El axe-o!
More sheep stares. Great. He looks around, heads for...
INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
Jesse jogs into this room (no one in here -- he’s currently
got the place to himself). His pace slows as he notes TOOLS
galore. Jackpot!
He picks up a large BALL-PEEN HAMMER, tests its heft. Nice.
But wait -- a SLEDGEHAMMER! Better! Hold on... here’s a
CROWBAR. That’ll come in handy. He’s trying to figure out
the best way to carry all this heavy stuff when...
... He notes a huge gray CIRCUIT-BREAKER BOX on a nearby
wall. The sight of it pauses him. He wanders closer.
This thing is not the kind of deal you’d find on the side of
your house. It is definitely heavy-duty INDUSTRIAL SIZE,
with fat steel cable conduits about six inches in diameter.
Off Jesse, wheels turning... coming up with a better plan:
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING - CONTINUOUS
Extreme LOW ANGLE UP past Walt as he MOVES THROUGH the lab,
peering up into the bright LIGHTS high above. No sign of the
fly right now. But Walt can hope.
NEW ANGLE. Suddenly, almost as if taunting him... BZZZZ-ZZ.
The FLY lands nearby. Low enough to reach.
Walt moves slow-wwly... pulse quickening... fly saber gently
twitching... as our hero closes on his prey.
WALT
There we go... Say goodnight...

Raising the swatter over his head like a samurai, Walt is
ready to... END THIS FUCKING THING! But just as he SWINGS --
-- THUNK! The LIGHTS GO OUT. Instantly, this is followed by
an unseen CRASH as disoriented Walt loses his balance.
WALT (O.S.)
AHH! BITCH --
EMERGENCY LIGHTS click on. They don’t do much down here --
but they allow us a few wall washes of murky eerie RED GLOW.
Just enough...
... To catch GLIMPSES of Walt in silhouette muttering
angrily, KNOCKING things over as he tries to find his way
around. He stumbles and barks his shin --
WALT (O.S.)
Son of a -- ! Dammit! --
-- Before he finally gets to where he wants to be. We hear
DRAWERS thrown open and searched. What’s he looking for?
A FLASHLIGHT -- it clicks on, illuminates his face. Briefly
casting him in a sort of “insane warlock” glow (he doesn’t
exactly shine it under his chin, however, as that would be
too self-consciously goofy).
His bright FLASHLIGHT BEAM dodging here and there around the
big lab (and maybe we have just a hint of smoke in the air to
really make it stand out?), Walt beelines for the spiral
staircase. He hurries up it to the catwalk.
He’s not heading for the exit. Instead, he’s here to check
the ELECTRICAL BOXES which line the catwalk wall. He wants
to fix the goddamned power and get back to the business of
killing flies. But before he can examine these boxes...
... There’s a TAP-TAP on the lab door. Jesse smiles in at us
through the little window (he’s got LIGHT out there where he
is, by the way). His voice is muffled through the glass.
JESSE
Need some juice, maybe?
Walt gets it now, and his face falls. He’s been outfoxed.
Clever Jesse -- looks like he’s got Walt over a barrel.

freshly returned from a whirlwind shopping trip.
JESSE
Knock yourself out.
We are:
INT. SUPERLAB - BREAK ROOM - MORNING
A half-hour has passed since the end of Act Two. Walt
quickly digs through the bags, hoping for something which may
prove useful. With disdain, he holds up a FLY SWATTER.
JESSE
It’s a REAL one.
Walt snorts and tosses it aside. Jesse’s offended.
JESSE
Yeah, like yours was working.
Walt pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He frowns at his partner.
WALT
No... no... no...
(off Jesse)
Look, we’re trying to decontaminate. You don’t
decontaminate by contaminating
further.
Jesse rolls his eyes -- whatever, man. Walt pulls out more
items: BUG BOMBS, GRANULAR FLY BAIT, an ULTRAVIOLET TRAP.
One by one, he summarily tosses them aside.
WALT
What the hell is all this?
Jesse reaches into an untouched bag, pulls out a “GOLDSTICK”
FLY TRAP. The kind that one hangs like an unfurled roll of
film. He DANGLES it enticingly in front of Walt.
JESSE

Walt takes it from him, looks it over. Reading the label:

Alright, I bought a whole buttload.
We can hang ‘em up all over the
place. It won’t be able to resist.
Jesse’s selling it, staying cheerful. Off Walt, considering:
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING
Fifteen minutes later. TWO DOZEN FLY TRAPS dangle around the
lab like so many nightmarish Christmas ornaments.
Walt perches at the top of a LADDER. Jesse stands below,
hands up the last trap for Walt to hang.
Walt does so, all the while distractedly scanning for the
fly. He’s exhausted. We see the toll this is taking on him.
WALT
I sure hope we have enough.
Jesse glances at the ridiculous number of these trap things.
We’re basically surrounded by them. (Maybe it’s at this
point -- for the line that FOLLOWS -- that we truly see how
many of these things there are.)
JESSE
I’m gonna go out on a limb and say,
uh, yeah.
WALT
(re: the fly)
Do you see him?
Jesse shakes his head. Walt sighs and climbs down. Half to
himself, as if not realizing he said this already...
Jesse studies Walt, worried for him. Trying not to show it.
JESSE
How long you think you’ve been
awake?
WALT
Why do you keep asking me that?

JESSE
Just figure you could use some
coffee, is all. I know I could.
(walks off, glancing back)
How ‘bout it?
Nice and nonchalant. Walt considers, nods. Jesse crosses
the lab to Gale’s science-y COFFEE MACHINE.
NEW ANGLE -- Jesse steps up to it, taps off a couple mugs of
steaming java, glancing over his shoulder to Walt... who
stands his ground, preoccupied. Walt’s eyes cast around the
lab for his elusive enemy, the fly.
Making the most of this moment, not knowing how long it may
last... Jesse quickly pulls something from his JACKET POCKET.
JESSE
You take cream and sugar?
WALT
Black’s fine.
It’s a small BOTTLE of over-the-counter SLEEPING PILLS.
Quietly, Jesse unscrews it. He pokes a thumbnail through the
protective FOIL (he bought this on his recent shopping trip --
obviously, this one purchase was the entire point of going).
CLOSE ON Jesse’s hand as MANY PILLS pour into his palm. Too
many. Half the bottle. Jesse hurriedly tips some back where
they came from. Now he’s got about SEVEN PILLS left in hand.
Jesse chews his lip a second, agonizing. Too many? Too few?
Finally... Screw it. Lucky number seven. He slips the pills
into Walt’s COFFEE. This is in no way nefarious. It’s an
act of compassion. Jesse stirs the concoction with a spoon.
JESSE
Why don’t you just, uh, leave him
be? Let the traps do the work.
Grabbing his own mug too, so as not to seem suspicious, Jesse
crosses back to Walt, offering him his very “special” coffee.
Walt absently takes it.
JESSE
Those pheromones are supposed to
kick ass. I bet we catch this mofo
any second.
Walt can’t help but stay on the lookout. Jesse continues to
eye Walt closely, wanting to prompt him to drink up...

but knowing better than to do that. Soon, Walt absently
takes a small SIP. No reaction to the taste. So far, so
good.
Walt takes another sip. Lets himself settle down a little.
This is the first time he’s been truly static in HOURS. He
can’t quite let himself relax, however. Still watchful.
Jesse hangs nearby, trying for nonchalance as he waits for
the pills to kick in. Makes conversation.
JESSE
You ever have like, a wild animal
trapped in your house?
Often for Walt, Jesse’s questions are simply so much annoying
background noise. This one’s no different.
WALT
Not that I can recall, no.
JESSE
We did, this one time. Back when
it was my aunt’s house, back before
she died of cancer. Was a possum.
Big, freaky looking bitch.
(then)
Hey, since when did they change it
to “O-possum?” What’s up with
that? When I was coming up, it was
just “possum.” “Opossum” make it
sound like he’s Irish or something.
Why they gotta go changing
everything? Whatever. It’s just
big rats anyways -- giant pinktailed rats with their pink rat
faces. Totally freaky, like, alien
rats.
Walt heaves a heavy sigh, burdened by everything, including
Jesse’s stupid story. He sips. Keeps his eyes peeled.
Jesse keeps talking, hoping Walt will start to fade.
JESSE
And so, it’s not so much that it
got trapped but he was living
there, you know? Under the house.
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room. Always, uh,
scurrying around down there.

WALT
(mostly just weary)
Is there a discernible point to
this story? A point that youyou’ll be arriving at some time in
the near future?
Just so long as Walt keeps drinking coffee, Jesse is happy --
no point getting the old bastard riled up. He shrugs.
JESSE
It was just a total bitch to get
out. Took forever. A guy came.
Set all these traps and all. And
he, he finally got him. But my
aunt... you know, she didn’t
believe it. I mean, she kept
insisting she could still hear the
thing. And you could not tell her
any different. I mean, she started
keeping an old umbrella, you know,
by her chair. Man... She’d just
bang on the floor and yell at it.
Even gave it a name...

She got like that. Toward the end.
Got obsessive about stuff, just got
mad about stuff. We didn’t know
what was up. It wasn’t like her,
to, uh, be that way.
Jesse chews his lip, considering. He glances at Walt.
JESSE
Turned out that the, um, the
cancer, had spread to her brain and
that was why. It, um,
metastasized. But it was good that
was when we decided to, you know,

It was a lot better after that.
Y’know, she was a lot happier.
A silent, expectant pause. Jesse, having made his point
either accidentally or by design, watches Walt, hopeful he’ll
catch on.
Walt considers Jesse’s words... and more than that, Jesse’s
concern. Once more, he looks to the ceiling. To himself:
WALT
Where the hell is he?
Leaving Jesse (and us) to wonder if Jesse’s sudden suspicion
is correct. Has Walt’s cancer progressed? Is it the cause
of his strange behavior? Does Walt even know?
Walt sips his coffee. His back is to Jesse, who watches him,
unsure what to say or do now. In fact, Walt got the point
after all. Finally, he answers Jesse’s implied question.
WALT
I’ve been to my oncologist, Jesse.
Just last week.

I’m still in remission. I’m
healthy.

Okay, so, good. Great.

That’s great.

But it had to be before she found

before that.
Walt is forlorn. Exhausted. Not just from all those
sleepless nights, nor even the sleeping pills, but from
something deeper. Jesse thinks he recognizes it.
JESSE
“Perfect moment?” For what -- to
drop dead?
(off Walt’s silence)
What? You saying you wanna die?
WALT

I’m saying I’ve lived too long.

You want them to actually miss you.
You know? You want their memories
of you to be...
(shakes his head)
But she just won’t, she just won’t
understand. I mean, no matter how
well I explain it, these days she
just has this... this...

I truly believe there exists some
combination of words. There must
exist certain words in a certain
specific order that would explain
all of this. But with her, I-I
just, I just can’t ever seem to
find them...
Maybe the pills are allowing Walt to let his guard down. He
wouldn’t normally share this much with Jesse -- or anyone.
JESSE

down?

Yeah. I remember.

But afterward, I stopped at a bar.
It was odd. I never do that! Go

sat down...

Of course I didn’t know it at the

What about family?
Walt isn’t so far gone that he doesn’t get how important all
this is to Jesse. He studies Jesse, takes him seriously.

I told him that I had a daughter,
and he told me that he had one,
too.

And he said never give up on

advice.

WALT (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
Jesse stares, not sure what to say to this. Not sure if it’s
some figment of Walt’s imagination. It unsettles him.
Walt stands here, haunted by his memories of that night.
Specifically, of what happened after he left the bar.
WALT
The universe is random. It’s not
inevitable, it’s simple chaos.
It’s subatomic particles in
endless, aimless collision. That’s
what science teaches us.
(then)
But what is this saying? What is
it telling us, when on the very
night that this man’s daughter
dies...
(still quieter)
... It’s me who’s having a drink
with him?
(to Jesse; truly asking)
How can that be random?
Walt struggles with his heavy burden. He’s managed to dance
them to the edge of a very dangerous precipice. What will
happen if he gives in and tells Jesse the truth about Jane?
Just then, Walt FALTERS a bit, nearly losing his balance.
The pills are kicking in. Jesse takes the mug from him. He
stands by, ready with a steadying hand.
JESSE
Hey. Sit down.
Not fighting -- Walt simply shakes his head no. He’s hanging
in there. His thoughts come back full circle.
WALT
No. That... No, no... That was
the moment. That night. I should
never have left home. Never gone
to your house. Maybe things
woulda...
He trails off, not quite ready to completely spill his guts.
WALT
I was, I was at home watching TV.
Some, some nature program about
elephants. Skyler and Holly were
in another room. I could hear them
on the baby monitor. She was
singing a lullaby.

(CONTINUED)
Ah, if I had just lived right up to
that moment and not one second
more...
A faint BZZZZ. Walt glances up at the FLY, not surprised to
see it. Oddly, its appearance doesn’t throw him off-subject.
For Walt, the fly seems of a piece with all of this.
WALT
... That would’ve been perfect.
Silence as Walt and Jesse each ponder that particular night,
each absorbed in his own thoughts.
The fly descends to alight nearby on top of a tall vessel,
visible to Walt and Jesse in b.g. Off this static tableau:

WALT (CONT'D)
ACT FOUR
WE’RE MOVING. SPINNING... BANKING... CLIMBING. CATCHING
brief glimpses of chrome, floor, electric light and two human
beings. A kaleidoscope of SHADOW and LIGHT getting BRIGHTER
as we move FASTER and FASTER and then, suddenly -- STOP.
We orient ourselves, revealing that we are:
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING
It’s mere seconds after the end of Act Three. We’re on the
ceiling. Looking DOWN upon Walt and Jesse, who stand in the
middle of the lab, looking UP at us.
We REVERSE -- looking up LOW FROM THE FLOOR past Walt and
Jesse to the FLY above. The fly’s a dot on the high DUCTWORK
an impossible twenty feet up. May as well be on the moon.
WALT
He’s not coming down.
Walt steadies himself against a vat or tank or somesuch --
Jesse’s sleep concoction is kicking in a little more now.
JESSE
Must be Thailand-hot up there.
That’s why he likes it.
(turns to Walt)
Thailand’s hot, right?
WALT
Yeah.
JESSE
Right. That’s why.
Walt’s flagging. All Jesse has to do is sit tight and wait
for him to pass out. But Mr. White’s been so fucked up and
sad today... he kinda wants to do something for him.
JESSE
Hey, wait. Here...
WALT
He’s not coming down. He’s staying
up there forever.
Staring at the man, he considers a moment. Deep sigh. Ah,
the hell with it. Jesse goes into action -- glancing around
McGyver-like, he rolls over twin stainless steel CARTS.

(CONTINUED)
WALT
What’re you doing?
JESSE
Whaddya think?
(determined)
I’m gonna get that bitch.
Jesse grabs the nearby ladder Walt was using in Act Three.
Arranging the rolling carts beneath the spot on the ductwork
where the fly is lounging, he stacks the A-frame ladder atop
the tall carts, one leg balanced on each. Looks dangerous.
Actually, it looks really goddamned dangerous. As Jesse
carefully climbs it, Walt frowns, concerned.
WALT
No. You’re gonna break your neck.
JESSE
Yeah, yeah...
Walt’s long FLY SABER is clenched in Jesse’s teeth as he
climbs. The higher he gets, the WOBBLIER this whole
arrangement becomes. Maybe it even ROLLS on its cart wheels
a little. Walt quickly steps over to steady it.
WALT
Seriously -- you’re... this is a
bad idea.
High above, Jesse is nervous, but going for it. On the third
step from the top, he’s nosebleed-high, and yet...
... WHI-IFFF! -- the fly is several FEET out of reach.
JESSE
Dammit.
Walt softens as he watches Jesse way up there, taking on the
fly for him, risking his neck. All in all, he’s a good kid.
Jesse deserves the truth.
WALT
Jesse..?
JESSE
Just hold onto it. Hold it still.
Jesse carefully climbs one more step. Now he’s precariously
balanced on the LAST step from the ladder’s very top.
And down below, Walt wants to come clean.

WALT
Jesse.
Jesse swings -- WHIFFF! Closer... but no cigar.
WALT
I’m sorry.
JESSE
Sorry for what? Being a lunatic?
Jesse stretches farther, swinging high, tip-toed and
overhanded like a tennis serve. Closer still, but WHIFFF!
WALT
I’m sorry about Jane.
Jesse pauses, glances down at him. Then, his eyes return to
the task at hand.
JESSE
Yeah. Me too.
WALT
(meaningful)
I mean I... I’m very sorry.
Even if Jesse kills him over it.
JESSE
It’s not your fault.
(then)
It’s not mine neither. It’s no
one’s fault. Not even hers.
Fuck it. Jesse... carefully... mounts the ladder’s very TOP
STEP. Raising his long flyswatter slowly... gingerly...
WHIFF! Inches away. Maybe if he stretches a bit further...
Walt stares up at him, barely breathing -- for more reasons
than one. He so wants to believe what Jesse just told him.
JESSE
We are who we are, Mr. White. You
know, two junkies with a duffel bag
fulla cash? Like you said, we both
woulda been dead within a week.
Walt reacts -- like I said? He can scarcely believe Jesse
remembers that. That he actually takes stock in it.
Looking up, still fixated on that fly, just out of reach...

JESSE
(softly; to himself)
I miss her, though. God, I do.
Down below, Jesse’s words have shifted something inside Walt.
Cleared his mind. Jesse hasn’t (unwittingly) absolved Walt
of guilt here -- not even close. But it’s enough of a
reprieve, enough of a mercy, to shake him loose a little.
WALT
(fading fast)
Jesse, come down.
JESSE
I’m so close.
WALT
Let it go. We need to cook.
Jesse turns and looks down at Walt, nonplussed.
JESSE
What about contamination?
Walt steps a few feet away, slumps into a nearby lab CHAIR.
WALT
It’s all contaminated.
Jesse rolls his eyes, shrugs. Great. Let’s cook. He tosses
away his fly saber, starts to carefully make his way down the
ladder.
JESSE
Alright. Definitely scared him.
He’ll probably stay out of the
way...
But NOW -- the fly lands on the ladder right in FRONT of
Jesse’s face. Shit! He tossed away the swatter! Idiot!
But he remembers: the crossword. He slo-wly reaches in his
back pocket, pulls out the NEWSPAPER, lifts his arm and...
... THWACK! His swing NEARLY TOPPLES the ladder, but he
steadies himself. And then:
JESSE
YEAH! --
His POV as the fly PLUMMETS in heroic, SLOW MOTION, like King
Kong falling off the Empire State Building. Falling down...
down... to the floor.

(Or honestly, if this shot as described is impossible to
execute -- then simply JESSE’S POV of the already-dead FLY
lying on the floor below. Maybe giving us one last TWITCH).
JESSE
Oh! Zzzzzap! Somebody got GOT,
yo! You see that Mister..?
Jesse looks over, noticing something now. His grin fades a
little... soon replaced by a deeper form of satisfaction.
Walt missed it. He is slumped in his chair, fast asleep.
Finally. Off Jesse, silently pleased...
INT. SUPERLAB - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER
LOW and CLOSE on CHAIR WHEELS rolling.
Jesse PULLS Walt towards the Break Room by his ankles,
rickshaw driver-style.
INT. SUPERLAB - BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jesse moves dead-weight Walt onto the couch. It’s a bit of a
struggle but he works gently, and manages. He covers Walt
with his JACKET. Sweet.
Time to make the donuts. Jesse flips off the lights in the
break room, letting Walt sleep...
... As Jesse walks into b.g. He dons heavy RUBBER GLOVES.
Off him opening up the mix/cook tank and pouring in the
sodium hydroxide, thus continuing the COOK...
EXT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY - DAY - MANY HOURS LATER
Out of blackness, SEARING BRIGHT SUN fills frame. We’re
walking out of the LAUNDRY BUILDING, glancing heavenward.
Squinting into the afternoon SUNLIGHT. We’re in the POV of:
WALT, who is heading for his Aztek. Jesse walks alongside,
heads for his Tercel. It’s the end of one long and
nightmarish shift -- yet Walt is looking better than when we
last saw him. Sleep helped.
In fact, currently Jesse looks more tired than Walt. Walt
can’t help but ask, probably for the third or fourth time:
WALT
Bins are packed?

JESSE
(nodding; stays patient)
Bins are packed.
WALT
How’s the yield?
JESSE
Two-oh-two and change. You okay
getting home?
WALT
Yeah. Better.
(then)
Thanks.
JESSE
(nods; it’s cool)
Mañana then.
Poker-faced Jesse fires up his after-work cigarette as Walt
climbs in his Aztek. For a moment Walt just sits here,
mulling something over. He rolls down his window and
gestures to Jesse. Come here.
WALT
Jesse! Come here!
Jesse sidles over. Walt isn’t angry, he’s concerned.
WALT
I couldn’t chance saying it inside.
For all I know, the lab’s wired for
sound.
(off Jesse’s frown)
That half a pound I said we’re off
by. Now, I’m not accusing you.
But if, you understand...
Jesse’s face hardens. Walt hesitates. Quietly presses on.
WALT
... And if they ever found out...
Jesse simply stares at Walt. Stone-faced. Defiant.
JESSE
I didn’t take shit.
WALT
(stares; now knows he did)
I’m just saying that I won’t be
able to protect you.

JESSE
Who’s asking you to?
The sweet Jesse of earlier is gone. Walt finally gives in,
lets it slide. A problem for another day. A big problem.
Walt starts his car and drives away. Off the inscrutable,
hard-assed “new” Jesse of Season Three, watching him go:
INT. WALT’S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Late at night. Same as before. Red phantom eye of the smoke
detector still blinking. Only now, Walt is sleeping
peacefully, his demons banished back into his subconscious.
For the moment, at least. For this short moment, it’s quiet.
Only the sound of Walt’s measured breathing. Until...
... out of nowhere, as if prodded by nightmares, he AWAKENS
with a start. He lies here, staring up into the dark.
Listening. As... wait for it... BZZZ-Z. Another FLY.
It lands above us on the blinking detector. Sits there.
Off Walt, silently staring up at it...
