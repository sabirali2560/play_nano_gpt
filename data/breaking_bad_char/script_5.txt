MEXICAN VILLAGE
TEASER
Spanish-style Flamenco guitar serenades us, as we open on:
EXT. MEXICAN VILLAGE - DAY
A soaring LANDSCAPE of a rural Mexican village tucked between
lush foothills bathed in sunlight. The sawtoothed peaks of
the Sierra Madre loom majestically on the horizon.
We’re in the Mexican heartland. Not parched and squalid,
like we’ve seen in our border-town scenes. But verdant and
serene -- a picture of pastoral charm.
We’ll use STOCK FOOTAGE for this, but in the best-case
scenario, we’ll see quaint peasant dwellings clustered around
the stone bell tower of a Catholic church, campesinos towing
donkeys or prodding goats down cobbled alleys, smiling
children playing in abundant fields of maize or grain.
And lots of happy CHICKENS foraging freely in the fields and
among the abodes. Maybe we hear a rooster crow.
Over these images, we hear an avuncular, Spanish-accented
narrator (think the late Ricardo Montalban):
NARRATOR (V.O.)
In the little village where I was
born, life moved at a slower
pace... yet felt all the richer for
it. There, my two uncles were
known far and wide for their
delicious cooking.
We cut to an antique sepia PHOTO of two proud mustachioed
brothers in traditional peasant garb and sombreros.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
They seasoned their zesty chicken
using only the freshest herbs and
spices. People called them “Los
Pollos Hermanos” -- the Chicken
Brothers.
By now we know we are watching a commercial for Gus'
restaurant chain, Los Pollos Hermanos -- one that evokes
nostalgia for a better time and a feeling of old-fashioned,
organic freshness. (Cynics will note that Gus' food is fried
to hell, and not particularly Mexican, but that’s part of the
fun here.)
(CONTINUED)
Off the antique photo of the Brothers, we cut to...
... CHICKEN PARTS -- breasts and wings and thighs fried to a
crispy golden brown and artistically backlit -- falling and
tumbling through the air in slow-motion. Mmmm! We’d
practically kill for a fix of that chicken.
NARRATOR (V.O)
Today, we carry on their tradition
in a manner that would make my
uncles proud.
Falling chicken DISSOLVES into a matching shot of...
... falling CRYSTALS OF BLUE METH! Sparkling and beautiful --
like so many shards of glittering blue-tinted glass --
raining down in slow motion. In effect, exposing the “real”
business behind Gus’s chicken empire. The camera follows the
blizzard of blue as it snows into a RUBBERMAID container.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
The finest ingredients are brought
together with loving care, then
slow-cooked to perfection. Yes,
the old ways are still best at Los
Pollos Hermanos. But don’t take my
word for it. One taste and you’ll
know.
A short and tasteful LOS POLLOS JINGLE (sung off-camera)
wraps up our little commercial as we now continue on with an
artfully flowing visual tour of meth distribution 101.
Production Note: where exactly the narration ends is not
crucial. Most likely, this will be a discovery made in the
editing room. Visually, the point to make here is that big
business merges effortlessly with Scarface-level drug crime.
WIDER. Now we realize we are...
INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
WALT, dressed in his Tyvek and rubber gloves, is hard at work
filling the Rubbermaid and sealing it shut. He slides it to
JESSE, identically attired and working the DIGITAL SCALE at
the weigh station. Jesse weighs it -- then onto a handtruck
goes this last of FIVE IDENTICAL, FULL RUBBERMAIDS. And now
Walt and Jesse’s part of the process is finished.
Reveal VICTOR, ready to take it from here. Stone-faced as
always, he wheels the two hundred pounds of product on its
handtruck. In some nice MATCH-CUT to the next scene...
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 2.
CONTINUED:
INT. FACTORY FARM - WAREHOUSE - DAY
... Victor pushes the handtruck into the WAREHOUSE at the
chicken-processing facility we first saw in Episode 303.
Inside, EIGHT OR TEN WORKERS, all dressed in similar Tyvek
suits, stand and work at various stations in a kind of
assembly line. We follow the Rubbermaid of meth from station
to station, glimpsing brief images of Gus' workers as they:
-- divide the meth into smaller portions and carefully pack
it into plastic baggies.
-- submerge the bags of meth into large plastic jugs of THICK
FRY BATTER. The workers then mark the jugs by scratching the
lids with jackknives (the marks are tiny, you wouldn’t notice
them if you weren’t looking).
-- intersperse the marked jugs containing meth among many
other identical jugs (not containing meth), all of them lined
up on shelves and ready for loading. The shelves are labeled
by destination: Amarillo, Dallas, Las Vegas, Phoenix, etc.
-- then wheel loads of the jugs on handtrucks outside, to...
EXT. FACTORY FARM - LOADING DOCKS - DAY
The loading area. The workers wheel the jugs onto a loading
dock and into a Los Pollos Hermanos REFRIGERATED TRUCK.
We pull back WIDE to reveal not just this one truck, but
two..? four..? six..? many Pollos Hermanos trucks. This is
one major operation. And a well-oiled machine.
The workers finish packing and shut the tailgates. The
trucks trundle away, exiting the factory farm in a long line
like elephants on parade. And watching them go...
... We reveal GUS, the man who makes it all happen. He
stands on his loading dock, impassively watching.
Out on the main road, our trucks split and fork off -- headed
in every conceivable direction. America, here we come.

ACT ONE
INT. SUPERLAB - AFTERNOON
CLOSE ON a digital SCALE READOUT. “160.2” it says in bright
blue letters, which then go dark. Now, as a full Rubbermaid
gets loaded aboard its empty scaletop...
... Up comes a new and updated readout: “201.6.”
Reveal Jesse, dressed in Tyvek. Yet another cook is finished
(not the same one depicted in the Teaser). Like all that
occurs in Walt’s lab, the weighing of the yield is an
exacting procedure.
Jesse’s job, which we are witnessing, is the task of working
the scale and calling out the measurement. (The scale has a
memory and automatically adds up the five containers of meth
per each cook, subtracting the containers’ tare weights.
There are FIVE CONTAINERS present, by the way -- the one
they’re on now is the last of the bunch to be weighed.)
JESSE
Two-oh-one point six.
(mildly annoyed)
Jesus. Seriously?
Reveal Walt standing by, recording the amount on a clipboard
(where he is, the readout happens NOT to be visible to him).
WALT
Better over than under.
JESSE
Over by a pound and a half? I
thought you were all, like,
“precise.”
(pops open the Rubbermaid)
Whatever. I’ll just save it out
till next week.
Quickly overriding Jesse, Walt re-seals the container.
WALT
We ship it as-is.
JESSE
What are we, running a charity?!
C’mon man, we’re gonna take it out!
WALT
Leave it. One batch, one ship.
Stop complicating things.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 4.
(CONTINUED)
Jesse finally gives up, bewildered -- but mostly pissed-off.
Walt ignores him, returns his attention to his clipboard.
Jesse frowns. Reads Walt -- is this extra amount by design?
JESSE
(outraged now)
Why are you purposely giving him
free meth?! These bitches are
bleeding us enough already!
WALT
You are paid extraordinarily well,
why can’t you just appreciate
that...
Distracted Walt files away his clipboard and crosses the lab
to the lockers (or wherever our changing area happens to be).
Jesse is on his ass the whole way.
JESSE
Yeah, yeah... hey. Hey, I been
crunching numbers, alright?!
WALT
(ah, wonderful)
Oh, you’ve been “crunching
numbers.”
JESSE
Yeah, I’ve been crunching numbers,
and I don’t gotta be a
mathematician to figure out this
deal you made is bullshit.
Walt, changing out of his cook gear and into his street
clothes, pauses to argue -- but Jesse cuts him off.
WALT
We both earn...
JESSE
Yeah, yeah, yeah -- million and a
half each, whoop-de-doo. What’s he
getting? Huh?!
(wait, I’ll tell you!)
Say he’s wholesaling at forty large
a pound --
WALT
-- That’s probably high.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 5.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
JESSE
High? What, for our stuff?!
That’s what I was getting! Okay,
look, say he’s getting forty a
pound, alright, two hundred pounds
a week for three months...
(off on a short tangent)
... And like, what happens at the
end of three months?
(before Walt can speak)
Look, what-whatever -- two hundred
pounds a week for three months --
that’s twenty-four hundred pounds.
2400 times 40,000 is -- and I swear
to God I double-checked this like,
ten times --
WALT
(without emotion)
-- Ninety-six million dollars.
Jesse blinks, staring at him intently -- you already fucking
KNEW that?! A short, perfect beat, then:
JESSE
Ninety-six million dollars!
Alright, ninety-six! Million!
Ninety-six to our three!
(points accusingly)
That is messed up, yo. That is so
messed up, fairness-wise, I can’t
even...
If this financial division bothers Walt (and it may indeed),
it’s hard to tell. Currently he’s in no mood to argue.
WALT
Jesse, you are now a millionaire.
And you’re complaining? What world
do you live in?
JESSE
One where the dudes who’re actually
doin’ all the work ain’t gettin’
fisted!
(quieter now; means it)
What is going on with you lately?
What’s happened to you..?
Walt finishes dressing and climbs the spiral staircase.
JESSE
Hang on, can’t you just -- we gotta
hash this out! Hey!

(CONTINUED)
(Walt isn’t stopping)
What’s more important than MONEY?!
Up on the catwalk, Walt exits the lab door without a look
back. As if in answer to Jesse’s question, we CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL - HANK’S ROOM - AFTERNOON
TIGHT ON HANK, asleep in bed. He’s hooked to an IV and a
couple of monitors. His torso is bandaged and there’s
catheter bags and tubes in evidence (as always, all this is
dressed as per the expert advice of our MED TECH).
This is the first really good, long look at Hank we’ve gotten
since the shoot-out in 307. He’s pale and wan. Except for
his faintly rising chest, we’d barely guess he’s alive.
In his room, cards, flowers and gift baskets abound. We
reveal MARIE, SKYLER, WALTER, JR... and Walt, who has come
straight from his lab. It’s maybe an hour later.
Some sit, some stand. Grim faces all around. Especially
Walt, who is wallowing in guilt, ruminating on exactly what,
if anything, he had to do with Hank being here. A question
he’s been chewing on since the legless Cousin vaulted off the
hospital bed and crawled after him last episode.
Marie gently fluffs the pillow under Hank’s head, careful not
to wake him. Softly:
MARIE
These things they laughingly call
pillows... I would not give them to
prison inmates.
SKYLER
You want me to go ask for another?
MARIE
No. Just remind me to bring his
from home.
(apropos of nothing)
They’re not moving his legs enough.
There’s a soft KNOCK on the half-open door. Walter, Jr. is
quickest to see...
GOMEZ cautiously pokes his head in. He carries a large
shopping bag (we’ll find out what it contains in a minute).
GOMEZ
Hey, everybody.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 7.

JESSE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
Walt and Skyler manage faint smiles and nod hello.
Gomez smiles back, looking a bit anxiously at Marie (who,
last episode, we recall was none too keen on the DEA).
GOMEZ
Hi, Marie. Is it... okay if I
visit..?
Skyler shoots a glance to Marie -- be nice.
Marie isn’t exactly overjoyed to see him. However, Gomez is
hangdog-sheepish enough to be pitied... and besides, Marie
has no energy left with which to nurse a grudge.
MARIE
Yeah.
She gives a nod, and Gomez quietly eases a step or two into
the room, staring down at Hank with sad compassion. Wanting
to fill the grim silence with something, anything...
GOMEZ
His, uh... color looks good.
Bullshit. Hank’s a half-shade brighter than cadaver-gray.
Still, the others give small nods of agreement.
Just then, Hank GROANS softly, painfully: “Uhhhhh...”
Gomez blanches. Uh-oh! -- Hank’s a lot worse than Gomez
thought. The others also look to Hank with concern.
Hank’s eyes stay closed. Like a ninety-year-old stroke
victim on his deathbed, his voice breathy, barely audible:
HANK
Gomie..? That you..?
Gomez’s eyes widen. The others stir, everyone slowly
gathering a bit closer to Hank’s bed.
GOMEZ
Buddy, it’s me.
HANK
(groggy whisper)
Thass you..? Gomie...
GOMEZ
Yeah, Hank. Right here.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 8.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
HANK
(seconds from death)
Come ‘ere... closer.
Gomez shoots Marie a fearful look. He swallows hard, steps
right up beside the bed and grips Hank’s forearm.
GOMEZ
What is it?
HANK
Closer...
A beat. Gomez bends so low that his ear is mere inches from
Hank’s lips. Suddenly, in a (more or less) NORMAL VOICE:
HANK
Asshole.
Punked! It would hurt too much to laugh, but Hank breaks
into a broad GRIN. Gomez realizes what just happened as
Walter, Jr. busts out laughing. The others chuckle. Even
Marie cracks a smile, loving this glimpse of the old Hank.
WALTER, JR.
Man, he got you good!
Gomez shakes his head -- you sonofabitch -- before he breaks
into a grin himself, hugely relieved.
GOMEZ
Yeah, yeah...
(to Hank)
Glad to see you still have your
twisted sense of humor.
Hank lets out a short laugh -- which just as quickly turns
into a bout of agonizing COUGHING. Ahh CHRIST, does that
HURT!! Hank loses that sense of humor real fast, ready to
sell his soul just to stop coughing. Marie puts a hand on
him, trying to settle him down and comfort him.
Back to grim reality while Hank’s pain very slowly subsides.
Frat-boy humor notwithstanding, this guy is really hurting.
Finally, Hank nods -- I’m good. Gomez, hoping to lighten
things up for his partner... or at least get the poor guy’s
mind off his troubles... reaches in his shopping bag (this
should probably be one of those brown paper Macy’s-type deals
with the twine handles, just something he had lying around).
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 9.

(CONTINUED)
GOMEZ
Hey, check this out. I got
something that’ll make you feel
better.
Gomez pulls out a MAP OF THE SOUTHWEST -- the one Hank used
for tracking places blue meth has been reported. (Or perhaps
we create an identical, yet slightly smaller version, and no
one will be the wiser!) But here’s the thing...
... It is now riddled with BLUE PUSH-PINS. There are lots
more than we ever saw before -- and plenty inside New Mexico,
and even ABQ, to boot. Gomez holds it up for Hank to see.
GOMEZ
I been keeping an eye on that blue
meth of yours. Six, seven weeks --
nothing, then all of a sudden, boom
-- it’s popping up everywhere.
Hank stares through half-lidded eyes, barely interested.
Walt, however, drinks in the map, alarmed and intrigued.
It’s his handiwork indicated by those many pins, after all.
He’s got to keep his interest a secret from everyone present,
however. That especially means Skyler, who is the only one
here who shoots him a brief glance. He notes it out of the
corner of his eye, yet doesn’t return it. Glancing down at
his shoes, Walt makes like Helen Keller.
GOMEZ
(to Hank; points them out)
Lookit the new locations. Texas,
Nevada... up in Farmington. Even
right here in town. I mean, a
teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts. But
man, it’s crazy.
When Hank speaks, it’s softly (projecting in a normal tone of
voice hurts too much).
HANK
How exactly that supposed to make
me feel better?
Gomez expected more of a reaction, considering Hank was
obsessed with the blue meth right until the day he was shot.
GOMEZ
‘Cause... you were right. You’re
the only one who saw this coming.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 10.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
HANK
Well, three cheers for me.
Hank’s attention drifts to a BUTTON placed within easy reach.
Folks may recognize it as a button which releases PAIN MEDS
via IV. Hank slowly fumbles for it, weak as a kitten. He
presses it once, twice, three times.
HANK
This thing doesn’t do a damned
thing.
MARIE
It’s probably still on lock-out.
HANK
It’s been an hour, right? I’m
hurting here. I could use some
meds.
MARIE
I’ll go find somebody.
(exiting; to Gomez)
No more shop-talk.
GOMEZ
Sorry.
Chastened, Gomez tucks away his map. Walt surreptitiously
watches it go. Is this news going to put the DEA back on his
trail? He’d like to dig around a little, see what Gomez
knows... only he doesn’t dare do this in front of Skyler.
Hank shifts a bit, trying to get comfortable -- or something
simulating comfort. His eyes return to Gomez.
HANK
I didn’t see it coming.
GOMEZ
What? Damn right you did.
HANK
Nah, I didn’t see shit. Day late
and a dollar short, as usual. Only
reason I’m even breathing is I got
a warning call.
A surprised beat. Walt, who had been staring at the floor,
listening, suddenly looks up. Skyler and Junior frown.
SKYLER
A “warning call?” What do you
mean?
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 11.
CONTINUED: (4)
(CONTINUED)
HANK
One minute before they attacked me,
somebody called my cell and told me
to expect it.
(to Gomez)
Voice scrambler. Coulda been
anybody. Marie’s got my phone
somewhere if you wanna run the
incomings -- not that you’re gonna
learn anything worth knowing.
Skyler looks to Walt, who is every bit as troubled and
bewildered as she is (which takes him a bit off the hook, as
she may be wondering if HE made that mystery call).
This call business is news to Gomez. And he’s stumped by it.
GOMEZ
I don’t get it. Cartel hit? Who
woulda called to warn you?
HANK
I dunno.
(painful spasm)
Ah, Jesus...
Gomez considers. Walt does, too. Skyler once again briefly
studies Walt’s troubled face. Hank cringes, hit by another
wave of pain. He CLICK-CLICKS his meds button.
Off Walt, worried about Hank, and perplexed by the revelation
of this “warning call”...
EXT. HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
Ten minutes later? An hour? His visit over, Walt climbs
into his Aztek. He shuts his door, breathes heavy. He stews
behind the wheel, trying to make sense of what he’s heard.
Before he can start his engine, the passenger door opens.
It’s Skyler. She slides into the seat, leaving the door ajar
-- her visit will be brief. As she opens her mouth, Walt
speaks preemptively...
WALT
Skyler, I had nothing to do --
She stops him with a gesture, a small shake of her head.
Giving no indication of whether she believes him or not, she
simply doesn’t want to hear it.
She looks Walt squarely in the eyes. Then, quietly:

SKYLER
Are we safe?
WALT
(a beat)
Yes.
Skyler reads him. Seems somewhat comforted by the answer.
She considers him briefly. Then, just as quietly:
SKYLER
Are you safe?
WALT
(a longer beat)
Absolutely.
And yet... we can tell Walt doesn’t really believe his own
answer. He is simply willing it to be true.
Off Walt’s uncertainty, Skyler studying him...

ACT TWO
INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Jesse, elbows on his knees, slumped low in a folding
chair. He stares off at nothing in particular. He may not
be miserable... but he certainly ain’t happy. Maybe his lips
silently move to the beat of a song which we can’t hear or
recognize. It’s one which plays only inside Jesse’s head.
A VOICE we might remember breaks his reverie.
GROUP LEADER
Jesse? Jesse, what about you?
Jesse’s attention shifts. CUT WIDE to reveal...
... A CIRCLE of about twenty people sitting in a meeting
space. We’re not back at the luxury rehab, but the attendees
at this recovery group are mostly younger and more upscale
than the folks we saw last season at Narcotics Anonymous.
The GROUP LEADER (who we first met in ep 301) watches Jesse
with interest. This is the first we’re seeing of it, but
Jesse’s been a regular at these meetings since he left rehab.
Jesse’s a paradox -- he might make a fortune cooking meth but
he’s absolutely committed to staying sober. This meeting is
Jesse’s safe haven; he and the Group Leader are building a
slender thread of trust.
GROUP LEADER
Face looks better. How’s it all
going? Anything you wanna tell us
about?
JESSE
What, like, my interesting life?
Uh... One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.
(a beat; what the hell?)
I been working a lot. I got a job.
GROUP LEADER
Job is good.
Jesse considers. He decides to be honest -- up to a point.
JESSE
It’s, um, it’s in a... laundromat.
It’s totally corporate.
The Group Leader frowns wryly. Not making fun, yet:
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 14.
(CONTINUED)
GROUP LEADER
A corporate laundromat.
JESSE
It’s like rigid, all kinds of red
tape. My boss is a dick. The
owner? Super-dick. I’m not worthy
or whatever to meet him but I guess
everybody's scared of the dude.
The place is full of dead-eyed
douchebags, the hours suck and
nobody knows what’s going on, so...
Jesse is surrounded by sympathetic faces, as everyone here
has suffered through a crappy job. But they’re probably not
picturing an underground superlab.
GROUP LEADER
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.
Jesse turns over the unfamiliar word.
JESSE
Yeah. Totally Kafkaesque.
(nodding)
Majorly.
He has 1.5 million reasons to be happy, but somehow fat
stacks don’t make up for being a cog in the machine. Off
Jesse, stymied and hating it:
INT. HOSPITAL - HANK’S ROOM - MORNING
RACKING to bleary-eyed Hank, propped up in his hospital bed.
Marie’s hoping to cheer him up by taking inventory of the
flower arrangements, cards and gift baskets that litter the
room. .
Although she has a lot on her mind, Skyler stays gently
supportive as she hands Marie the items one by one. Marie’s
not in denial, but she’s keeping it light as the sisters put
on their version of the Home Shopping Network for Hank.
Skyler hands over a large and colorful flower arrangement in
a Southwestern-style vase. Marie checks the card.
MARIE
Ooo... From the US Attorney in
Santa Fe! Very nice!
SKYLER
You’ve got all these nice tulips
there, and good baby’s breath...

MARIE
... This is chrysanthemum It looks
like chrysanthemum. Look at these,
Hank, aren’t they beautiful?
HANK
(who gives a fuck?)
Beautiful
Hank does his best play along, but he’s hurting. Skyler
reaches for the next item, hefting an impressive BASKET.
SKYLER
Wow, look at the size of this
basket. It’s got so many goodies
in it! Look. Chocolate-covered
pretzels and, uh, cheese sticks and
some fancy designer olives...
MARIE
You had me at cheese sticks.
You're gonna have to fight me for
those, Hank!
She says this as she opens the basket’s CARD. Reading aloud:
MARIE
“Get well and best wishes from Ted
Beneke and all the folks at Beneke
Fabricators!”
Skyler’s smile freezes in place. In the middle of this
crisis, Ted Beneke is the last person Skyler wants to think
about. The affair seems positively beside the point.
MARIE
Wow. He gives you all this time
off, and now this? Get me a job
there.
SKYLER
No. He’s great.
MARIE
Boss hall of fame. I don’t see
anything here from Kleinman --
they’re gonna have to get on the
stick.
Skyler’s saved from having to discuss Ted by a gentle KNOCK.
DR. NOCERA (No-see-ra), Hank’s spinal surgeon enters.
DR. NOCERA
How’s everybody doing today?
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 16.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
Marie tenses a bit as soon as she sees him. It’s nothing
personal, but doctors mean news about Hank’s condition. And
news can be good... or bad.
MARIE
Good! We’re good. How are you?
DR. NOCERA
I’m very good. Hi, Hank. We’re
just gonna do a quick peripheral
response, alright, see where we’re
at...
Marie and Skyler get out of Dr. Nocera’s way as he steps to
Hank’s bedside. The sisters exchange a glance. What’s on
their minds is what Hank now says out loud.
HANK
Moment of truth.
DR. NOCERA
Yeah, I wouldn’t call it that.
Alright, let’s just take a look
here. Uh... alright.
The doctor pulls back the bedclothes, revealing Hank’s feet
in clean hospital socks. He gently presses the tip of a pen
against the sole of Hank’s foot. (All this as per MED TECH!)
DR. NOCERA
Alright. I want you to tell me if
you can feel this.
Hank just shakes his head. He’s staring at the ceiling,
trying to pretend that none of this is happening.
All of Marie’s good humor is gone. Suddenly she looks like a
scared kid. Nocera tests different parts of Hank’s foot.
DR. NOCERA
How about this?
Hank shakes his head. The doctor peels back the sock on
Hank’s left foot. His skin looks pale, like it’s lacking
circulation. Again, he pokes.
DR. NOCERA
Okay. How bout now?
Hank’s eyes narrow as he concentrates. Good news?
HANK
Try that one again, wouldja?

DR. NOCERA
Right there?
HANK
(the doctor complies)
Yeah. Yeah, I feel, uh, a...
tingle.
DR. NOCERA
Okay, on a scale of one to ten?
Ten being your normal level of
feeling and one being no feeling at
all?
HANK
I dunno, uh. Four?
Nocera changes his angle.
DR. NOCERA
Okay. Four. Okay... And how
about there.
HANK
Yeah. Yeah. Uh... a six?
DR. NOCERA
Okay. Good. And, uh... here?
HANK
Yeah. Still there... but less. A
three.
DR. NOCERA
Okay. Alright. Good. Thank you
very much, Hank. Did good.
Hank dares to feel a little hopeful. Also, he is now bushed.
The doctor pulls the covers back over his feet and turns to
Marie and Skyler.
MARIE
So this is good news, right?
DR. NOCERA
Oh, yeah, definitely. It looks
like some nerve function is
returning.
SKYLER
Thank God.
Marie’s already racing ahead to the next logical step.

MARIE
Alright. So when do we get him
walking again?
But the answer to that question goes beyond medical science.
Off Dr. Nocera glancing to Hank, hesitating to answer...
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - MORNING - MINUTES LATER
Marie and Skyler have spent literally days in this room,
waiting for news about Hank. Now the two women sit across
from Dr. Nocera and a solicitous HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR.
DR. NOCERA
Marie, it’s important that we
manage our expectations. We’re
talking about months of very hard
work, and even then the odds...
they’re not great.
MARIE
But you can’t know for sure.
Nocera is trying to avoid raising false hopes.
DR. NOCERA
No.
SKYLER
When does he start physical
therapy?
The Hospital Administrator speaks up. She thinks she’s
delivering good news to Marie.
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR
We’ve sent the paperwork to your
insurance. It’s high priority, we
should have pre-authorization in
the next few days. Certainly by
early next week.
MARIE
“Next week?” Uh, no. That’s not
gonna do it. I’ve looked into
this, and the sooner physical
therapy begins, the better his
chances are, and...
(to Dr. Nocera)
He needs daily sessions -- isn’t
that right?

DR. NOCERA
Well...
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR
(before he can answer)
Actually, your plan’s treatment
program covers four sessions a
week.
SKYLER
Actually -- she asked the doctor.
Both sisters turn to the man, who tries to remain politic.
DR. NOCERA
Um, plan-wise, four treatments a
week is fairly typical. And the
therapists in your network are
mostly fine.
MARIE
Mostly fine, okay... Well there’s
a ringing endorsement.
(low and intent)
Look. If-if Hank had more physical
therapy, with better therapists,
wouldn’t it be more likely he would
walk?
DR. NOCERA
(a beat)
It’s very hard to say, Marie. Is
the health plan’s way medically
justifiable? Sure. Is it
absolutely optimal..?
He doesn’t finish the thought. Thus, Marie has her answer.
MARIE
You know? Screw it. I’m gonna
make sure he gets what he needs,
they can just reimburse me later.
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR
Mrs. Schrader, I get your
frustration -- really, I do. But
my best advice is to stay in the
network. Don’t go out-of-pocket.
Physical therapy is just the
beginning. We’re talking nursing
care, modifications to your home,
occupational therapy, medical
equipment... It could run into the
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Truly, this administrator is no villain. It’s not the
woman’s fault, but she’s really getting on Skyler’s nerves.
SKYLER
So what? We’re just supposed to
compromise on his care?
HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR
Well, if you don’t follow the
insurance company’s procedures,
they may never pay you back. I’ve
seen patients and their families go
bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.
But Marie has no interest in doing it the insurance company’s
way. She turns to Dr. Nocera.
MARIE
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?
DR. NOCERA
I can give you some names. But
they’re not likely to be on your
plan.
MARIE
To hell with the plan.
Marie quietly rises, headed for Hank’s room without a look
back. She sounds strong, but Skyler knows she’s brittle to
the point of breaking. Off Skyler, remaining behind, wishing
there were some way she could help...
INT. NAIL SALON - DAY
CLOSE ON FEMALE HANDS expertly massaging clear fluid onto
male feet. This has to be a procedure on Hank’s extremities,
right? Not exactly.
Seems we’re in a NAIL SALON, and these... are SAUL GOODMAN’S
tootsies. He’s zoned out in a pedicure chair with his pant
legs rolled up. A pair of ASIAN BEAUTICIANS exfoliate his
feet. A couple OTHERS linger by the counter -- one reading a
newspaper and the other idly texting on her cell.
DING! The front door opens and Jesse enters, glancing around
the compact, clean salon. It’s slow at the moment, as Saul
is the ONLY customer (we can assume he arranged it this way).
SAUL
Hey... there he is! Finally! I
went ahead and started without you.

Nevertheless, hands in his pockets, he slouches toward Saul.
SAUL
Ladies, this is Jesse-San. He’s in
for the full treatment.
(to Jesse)
Hey, kick off your shoes, lay
back... exfoliate.
JESSE
Maybe later.
Saul glances past Jesse toward the door, looking for Walt.
SAUL
So, where’s the maestro? He out
parking the mini-van?
The mention of Walt just annoys Jesse.
JESSE
What I look like, his shadow? Who
cares where he’s at? What am I
doing here?
Saul glances at his watch and makes an executive decision.
SAUL
Hmm. I was gonna have you two flip
a coin. Since the genius can’t be
bothered...
(screw it)
Today’s your lucky day. Look
around, kiddo, it’s all yours.
JESSE
What? This?
SAUL
Yeah. You are now owner of this
fine establishment.
JESSE
For free?
Saul pretends outrage. The manicurists barely react as they
tuck spacers between Saul’s toes. They either don’t speak
English or more likely, they’ve seen Saul’s act before.
SAUL
“Free?” Oh ladies, cover your
ears!

(then)
At three hundred and twelve
thousand dollars, it’s a steal.
JESSE
Three hundred and twelve thousand?!
Saul glances down at the manicurists and lowers his voice.
SAUL
Don’t you get it? On the outside
it’s a nail salon, right -- on the
inside it’s the best money laundry
a growing boy could ask for.
Jesse squints at the lawyer, shakes his head and snorts --
ridiculous. He turns and heads for the door.
SAUL
Wait, wait, wait! Hey! Ladies,
thank you, good job. Come back
here.
The women drift away, busying themselves elsewhere -- texting
and what-not. Saul pulls out his toe spacers and dries off.
SAUL
Sit. Come on, come on. Humor me
for a second. Now... you know you
need to launder your money, right?
(Jesse stubbornly stares)
Do you understand the basics of it?
Placement? Layering? Integration?
Jesse lingers impatiently, ready to leave at any second.
JESSE
I ain’t buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it!
SAUL
You wanna stay out of jail,
dontcha? You wanna keep your money
and your freedom? Because I’ve got

Jesse is listening -- though for how long is anyone’s guess.
Saul decides that visual aids are in order. He clears the
manicure table and grabs a bottle of pink nail polish.
SAUL
Hey look. Here’s you, right?
Pink, Pinkman -- get it?
Saul dumps cotton balls out of a clear plastic container to
represent money. He’s trying a little too hard to keep his
explanation on Jesse’s level.
SAUL
‘Kay. Here’s your cash. You’re
out on the town, yeah, you’re
“partying hearty,” you’re knockin’
boots with the chicky babes. And --
uhh -- Who’s this?
He hovers the open side of the plastic box threateningly over
the pink nail polish and the cotton balls.
SAUL
It’s the Tax Man. And he’s looking
at you. Now what does he see? He
sees a young fella with a big fancy
house, unlimited cash supply and no
job. Now what is the conclusion
the Tax Man makes?
JESSE
(grudgingly)
I’m a drug dealer.
SAUL
Bzzt! Wrong! Million times worse -
- you’re a tax cheat! What do they
do?
THUD! Saul slams the box down, trapping the cotton balls.
SAUL
They take every penny! And you go
in the can for felony tax evasion!
He stomps open a pedal-style trash can and swipes the nail
polish right into it. He lets the lid close with a CLANG.
SAUL
Ouch! What was your mistake? You
didn’t launder your money. Now,
you give me your money -- that’s
called placement. Hand me that
little thing...

Jesse hands over a transparent cylinder filled with Q-Tips.
Saul adds the cotton balls to the cylinder, puts his hand
over the top and SHAKES it like a cocktail, mixing them.
SAUL
This is the nail salon, right? I
take your dirty money and I slip it
into this salon’s nice, clean cash
flow. That’s called layering.
In spite of himself, Jesse grows interested. But that
doesn’t mean he’s buying it.
SAUL
Final step: integration. The
revenues from the salon go to the
owner -- that’s you.
Saul spills out Q-Tips mixed with cotton balls. With pride:
SAUL
Your filthy drug money has been
transformed into nice clean,
taxable income brought to you by a
savvy investment in a thriving
business.
Logically it makes sense, but playing by the rules -- even
criminal rules -- rubs Jesse the wrong way.
JESSE
So, you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes? I’m a
criminal, yo.
SAUL
Yeah, and if you want to stay a
criminal and not become -- say, a
convict -- then maybe you should
grow up and listen to your lawyer.
Now Jesse sees Saul’s angle. This is all a sales job.
JESSE
Right. So you can get your five
percent.
SAUL
No, that’s seventeen percent.
JESSE
I heard you say five -- you said it
right in front of me!

Yeah, that was for your partner.
Privileges of seniority and all --
but for you it’s the usual

bargain.
But as soon as Saul starts talking about Walt, Jesse’s
already on his way out. Saul calls after Jesse.
SAUL
Hey, what? Hey... Listen to it!
Come on! I’m talking about your
future here! Listen to reason!
Off Jesse, out the door and gone...
EXT. AZTEK - HILLTOP - DAY
We open on an abstraction of sky and land. It’s the world
thrown WAY OUT OF FOCUS. Into this frame drives...
... WALT, slowly rolling to a stop into his own, IN-FOCUS
CLOSEUP. He sits here behind the wheel of his idling car,
staring off into the distance.
He glances down at a scratch-sheet of his own HANDWRITTEN
DIRECTIONS. Yeah, this is the place. He tucks it away, goes
back to staring. He stares for a long time.
Walt has been a mystery to us this Act. He wasn’t with
Skyler and Marie, he wasn’t with Jesse and Saul. We haven’t
seen him since Act One, when Sky asked him if all was safe.
Now, one look at Walt’s preoccupied, haunted eyes, and we
know he is thinking of nothing else but his family’s safety.
An o.s. RUMBLING approaches, getting louder. We finally see
what Walt is looking at.
EXT. FACTORY FARM - HILLTOP - CONTINUOUS
A POLLOS HERMANOS TRUCK rumbles past us. It WIPES our frame
revealing the long gray buildings of GUS’ FACTORY FARM spread
out beneath us at the bottom of the hill.

Here’s why Walt’s adrenaline is surging: he now knows how
dangerous Gus is. And he’s going to meet him in the heart of
his empire.
Girding his loins, Walt puts the Aztek into gear and rolls on
out of frame, headed down the hill.
EXT. FACTORY FARM - LOADING DOCKS - DAY
As in the Teaser, LABORERS load the Pollos Hermanos trucks.
A guy in a DARK JACKET watches the work.
Looking out of place, the Aztek putters past (a deliberate
pace, not rushing). The dark figure turns to coolly note
Walt’s arrival -- it’s VICTOR. No matter how casual Walt’s
entry to this place may appear, everything is choreographed.
INT. AZTEK - MOVING - CONTINUOUS
ANGLE THROUGH the windshield as the Aztek heads for the
OFFICE TRAILER. We’re in the back seat over Walt’s shoulder
as he pulls the Aztek to a stop near Gus’ Volvo wagon.
Walt idles, the office trailer visible straight ahead of us.
Its door opens and Gus appears at the top of the stairs,
looking down upon us pleasantly. He gives us a nod hello.
RACK to Walt’s eyes in the rearview mirror, gazing up at Gus.
Off Walt, shutting off his engine and climbing out:

Walt takes a seat across from Gus. It turns out Walt is in
the very chair Bolsa once occupied.
GUS
How is your brother-in-law?
WALT
He’ll live.
GUS
Good. I’m glad.
(off his silence)
Walter, you seem troubled. How can
I help you?

He’s meticulously planned every word. He speaks them softly.

I asked to see you in order to...

think it’s in our best interests to
just lay cards on the table.
Okay... interesting. Gus responds, noncommittal.
GUS
Well, that’s the best way to do
business.
WALT
My brother-in-law, moments before
he was attacked. Someone called to
warn him.
Gus says nothing. Walt continues, calmly reviewing facts.
WALT
I believe that same person was
protecting me. Those two men, the
assassins... I believe I was their
prime target. But that somehow,
they were steered away from me to
my brother-in-law.
(a beat)
Because of this intervention, I am
alive. And yet I think that this
person was playing a much deeper
game.
A consummate poker player, Gus simply listens. However, he’s
wondering why Walt is doing this. Why risk being so open?
WALT
He made that phone call because he
wanted a shoot-out, not a silent
assassination. In one stroke, he
bloodied both sides, set the
American and Mexican governments
against the cartel and cut off the
supply of methamphetamine to the
Southwest. If this man had his own
source of product -- on this side
of the border -- he would have the
market to himself. The rewards
would be... enormous.

I know I owe you my life. And more
than that, I respect the strategy.
(then)
In your position, I would have done
the same.
Shocking! This is Hank’s life he’s talking about! How can
Walt be so bloodless? Gus remains impassive. And yet, is
Gus impressed? Yes, we’re starting to sense that.
WALT
One issue which troubles me. I
don’t know what happens when our
three month contract ends.
GUS
What would you like to happen?
WALT
You know why I do this. I want
security for my family.
By security he means not just financial security -- but sure
knowledge of their safety.
GUS
Then you have it.
But what does that mean, exactly?
GUS
Three million for three months,
that was our agreement. Extended
annually, twelve million a year.
(then)
Call it fifteen. Open-ended.
Would that be agreeable?
Once Walt would have jumped at it. Now, he simply nods yes.
Walt has his 30 pieces of silver. By extending, he assures
his continuing usefulness to Gus. But at what cost?

LOW ANGLE on flat highway, inches above the blacktop. The
double lines converge into infinity. WOOSH! The Aztek
rattles past as Walt heads for home.
INT. AZTEK - MOVING - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Out of Gus’ presence, Walt slowly drops his mask of
detachment. He hates himself, hates what he’s done -- he’s
cemented a deal with the devil. He pretended that what
happened to Hank didn’t wound him to his core.
The money was unexpected -- and just makes it worse. Walt is
profoundly, utterly compromised. And what has he gained?
Has he really protected his family?
We linger on his face as he’s consumed by regret and selfloathing. The moment is punctuated by the irregular THUPTHUP of vehicles passing in the other lane. One thing’s for
sure, this anguished, torn man is anything but cold-blooded.
Walt’s foot presses on the gas. The Aztek whines and
shimmies as it picks up speed.
WHOOM! WHOOM! Cars rush past faster.
And then... gradually, very deliberately, he FLOORS IT.
The speedometer needle quivers. 70... 75... 86...
Now, as if resigned to his inevitable fate...
WALT CLOSES HIS EYES.
95... 98... 100...
THA-WOOM! THA-WHOOM! Cars and trucks FLICK PAST.
STAYING on WALT. We barely glimpse the world blurring past
as he literally drives blind. The head-on collision has got
to be coming. Any second. The only question is how many
innocent lives he’s going to take.
A protesting car horn DOPPLERS past. Tires SCREECH.
The Aztek sounds like it’s going to shake itself apart. It’s
rattling like a metal garbage can dragged over cobblestones.
For a strange moment Walt looks almost... serene.
Finally, self-preservation compels Walt to OPEN HIS EYES.

Nearly tipping over, the Aztek SHUDDERS to a stop.

A lazy cloud of DUST rises. As it drifts past him, Walt just
sits here, getting his breathing under control. For some
reason, today’s not the day to die.
The surge of adrenaline has brought Walt back into the
moment. Death will just have to wait.
And now he’s back to being Walter White. Just like his
Drivers’ Ed instructor taught him decades ago, Walt turns on
his blinkers. Hands on the wheel at ten and two, Walt checks
his mirrors and pulls back on the highway.

high school. Woodworking. I took
lots of vo-tech classes, ‘cause it
was just a big jerk-off. But this
one time I had this teacher name

Hmm. Is Jesse really talking about Mr. White? Actually, no.
JESSE
I guess he was like a Marine or
somethin’, before he got old. He
was hard of hearing. My, uh... my
project for his class was to make
this, um, wooden box. Like a
small... um... just, like...

... Like a box. You know, to put
stuff in. So I w-wanted to get the
thing done as fast as possible.
Um, I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester and he
couldn’t flunk me, so long as I,
you know, made the thing. So, I
finished it in a coupla days. It
looked pretty lame, but it worked,
you know, for putting stuff in and
whatnot.

So, when I, uh, showed it to Mr.
Pike for my grade, ah... he looked
at it and said “Is that the best
you can do?” At first I thought to
myself -- Hell yeah, bitch, now

Jesse looks around at the circle. Folks are engaged by his
story, which surprises him a bit... and keeps him going.

So I started from scratch and made
another. Then another. And by the
end of the semester -- by, like,
box number five? I had built this
thing...

You shoulda seen it. It was
insane! I built it outta Peruvian
Walnut with inlaid Zebrawood. It
was fitted with pegs -- no screws.
I sanded it for days, until it was
smooth as glass. Then I rubbed all
the wood with tung oil, so it was
all rich and dark. It even smelled
good. You know, you’d put your
nose in it and breathed in, it
was... it was perfect.

words to describe how proud he felt. We PAN across the
others, all of them inspired by his story. A beat.

TED
Can we just talk for a minute? I
know you need to be with your
family, but, uh, I haven’t heard
from you in days. I left messages.
SKYLER
I’m so sorry, you gave me and that
time off and I really should have --
TED
-- That’s not my point. I-I care
about you, that’s all.
SKYLER
Ted, it’s just... this whole thing
with Hank has been one non-stop
horror show, you know? So...
TED
(nods)
Well, I just want you to know that
I’m here for you.
SKYLER
Thank you.
(a pregnant pause; then)
But I really do need you to...
... Leave. As in now. Ted hesitates, not wanting to.
Furthermore, he doesn’t get why he even needs to. Meanwhile,
Skyler steps a few feet over to glance down the hall and
check if Marie is eavesdropping (no sign of it). That rubs
Ted a little wrong, as well.

Okay...
SKYLER
Okay.
TED
Skyler, I gotta say, your sister
seeing me here... I mean...
(hell, out with it!)
So what? I’m divorced, you’re
divorced. So what?
In fact, Skyler has not filed her divorce papers. But she
doesn’t want to get into that with him.
SKYLER
Let’s talk about this later, Ted,
okay?
TED
(a tad louder, but not
meaning to be)
Is there some need for secrecy I’m
not getting? ‘Cause --
SKYLER
Later, Ted. Not now.
TED
Skyler. Just tell me...
SKYLER
(frustrated; snaps)
You really wanna do this now?
Are you really gonna make me do
this right now?
Ouch. Ted gets it. We do, too. She’s talking about
breaking up with him. He’s hurt. And Skyler deeply regrets
having let him know in this manner. But the damage is done.
TED
Wow. Yeah, you’re right. Bad idea
to come here.
Ted turns, takes a step or two toward the door before Skyler
makes a mild attempt to mend fences.
SKYLER
Ted, I’m... I’ll see you in a day
or two? Back at the office?

Ted exits, knowing it’s the end of the affair. Off Skyler
quietly shutting the door behind him, then standing here...
wondering why everything in her life has to be so fucked-up
and painful and difficult...
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
Five or six CUSTOMERS. A UNIFORMED WORKER mans the cash
register, TWO OTHERS assemble sandwiches. Off all this, we
find... Jesse, BADGER, and SKINNY PETE. Our boys sit at a
table, just now unwrapping their subs.
Bwah-hah! Skinny Pete laughs as he and Badger bump fists.
Jesse, the “grown-up” of the group, finds this only mildly
amusing. While the guys eat...
BADGER
Can’t believe you had to crush the
RV. Musta been like... depressing.
SKINNY PETE
For real. That’s a stone loss.
JESSE
No one misses it more than me.
Jesse stares out the window, nostalgic for the good old days.
JESSE
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.
No quotas. No one to answer to.
As he keeps thinking about it, his mood darkens. He pauses
eating, sets down his sub. With quiet frustration:
JESSE
What’s the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?
BADGER
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the Death
Star.
SKINNY PETE
True that. Two of them bitches.
BADGER
(off Jesse’s annoyed look)
Just saying. Devil’s advocate.

Idiots. Jesse continues on with his thought.
JESSE
I gotta pay taxes now? What the
hell’s up with that?! That’s
messed up, yo. That’s Kafkaesque.
Badger and Skinny Pete don’t know this word any better than
Jesse does -- but damn, it sounds good. They both nod.
SKINNY PETE
Church.
BADGER
Right.
Jesse simmers a beat. Until finally -- fuck it.
JESSE
Let’s kick it back into gear.
Alright? Let’s start slingin’
again.
Skinny Pete and Badger study Jesse. Is he for real? Jesse
just stares back at them. Dead serious. Badger and Skinny
Pete share a sidelong glance. Then...
SKINNY PETE
Boo-yah, let’s do it! Life’s too
short -- that’s what I say!
BADGER
Hells yeah, bitches! We don’t need
no RV. Alls we need is a-a
bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles --
JESSE
Nah, nah, nah... no shake ’n bake.
Where’s your self-respect? Come
on.
SKINNY PETE
Yo, maybe it ain’t top-shelf,
but we could at least move it.
Still kinda dry out there -- it’ll
sell on the street.
JESSE
Who says we sell on the street?
Maybe I know a whole new market.
(then)
Maybe alls we need is the meth.
And maybe he knows just where to get it. Off scheming Jesse:

INT. SUPERLAB - DAY
TIGHT ON a hand clutching a BRIGHT BLUE CLOTH, scrubbing
intently at one of the superlab’s stainless steel surfaces.
The hand moves aside, revealing WALT’S REFLECTION. The field
of steel is gleaming and spotless, except for a single, small
stain of residue. Like a Hindu bindi, right between Walt’s
eyes. But black.
We hold on the reflection as Walt stares at the spot. But
it’s as if he’s looking through it -- not seeing it for what
it is. His mind is somewhere else. Until he looks over at:
JESSE. Wearing his iPod. The music is cranked, thinly
audible through his headphones. He weighs the FOURTH of FIVE
full and identical RUBBERMAIDS. Another cook is complete.
We HOLD on Walt as he studies Jesse. Worried. Guilty.
Should he tell him what he now knows for certain -- that Gus
is a murderous criminal, likely as dangerous as Tuco ever
was? That Walt just upped their deal -- a move calculated to
keep his own family secure, without regard to Jesse?
As Walt silently debates whether to spill his guts, Jesse
hoists the FIFTH and FINAL RUBBERMAID onto the scale. All
the while, bobbing his head to the beat.
Walt snaps out of it. Back to work. He grabs his clipboard.
WALT
What’s the yield? Hey.
Jesse pulls the headphones out of his ears -- huh? Walt
gestures at the scale.
WALT
The yield. Come on.
Jesse glances down at the DIGITAL READOUT (remember, as
established in the Teaser, Walt does not see it from where he
stands). Jesse’s POV: “202.1.”
JESSE
Two-oh-one point eight.
Hold up! Jesse is calling it one-third pound under the
actual weight! Why would he do that? We think we know.
Off this revelation that smooth Jesse is planning to STEAL
product from brilliant and scary GUS, we...

ACT FOUR
INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
Jesse is slouched in his usual seat, but tonight something’s
different about him. His eyes are alive and watchful, as if
he’s waiting for something. The meeting has just started and
the Group Leader spots a few newcomers.
GROUP LEADER
I see a couple of new faces.
Anybody wanna introduce themselves?
A chair CREAK. A faint COUGH. Nobody wants to go first.
GROUP LEADER
Don’t all speak at once.
In the shadows, a tentative hand rises. The Group Leader
nods. A big, shaggy guy speaks up.
BADGER
So my name’s Brandon?
Huh? What the hell is Badger doing in Jesse’s sanctuary?
GROUP LEADER
Okay, Brandon. You want to tell us
something about yourself?
Badger seems totally serious, sincere -- and tortured.
BADGER
Well, why I’m here... it’s, uh,
it’s just one thing. It’s meth.
It’s bad. I thought I had it
kicked a couple times, you know?
But then... Jesus. This... new...
version of it hit the streets, and
uh...
(eyes lowered)
Wow.
A new voice speaks from another part of the circle.
SKINNY PETE
Not that blue stuff?
Heads turn in his direction and Skinny Pete glances around,
embarrassed. Did I just say that out loud?
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 43.
(CONTINUED)
SKINNY PETE
(raising it now)
Oh, sorry. I didn’t raise my hand.
GROUP LEADER
No, go ahead. This is what we do.
Badger nods, addressing Skinny like he’s never laid eyes on
him in his life. By the way, for a couple of knuckleheads?
These two are doing a sober, remorseful, excellent job.
Jesse’s good, too. He listens with the same amount of polite
interest that everyone else exhibits.
BADGER
Yeah, exactly -- the blue stuff.
You had it, too?
SKINNY PETE
Yeah, bro -- and I wish I never
even heard of it. It was like
lighting my whole head on fire.
Badger and Skinny Pete are more subdued than we’ve ever seen
them before -- but we get it. Jesse has the guys pretending
to be strangers to one other. They’re playing the crowd like
three-card monte scammers.
BADGER
Yeah, that stuff’ll burn you down.
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is cause it’s long gone.
SKINNY PETE
That’s the shame of it.
Badger stares at Pete with real fear in his eyes.
BADGER
Nah, nah man. Don’t tell me that.
SKINNY PETE
(cringing; I’m so sorry!)
I hear it’s back in town. Stay
strong, brother. Stay strong.
Jesse casually scans the group. Jesse’s POV -- PANNING the
faces of recovering addicts. There are nods of sympathy and
understanding, but also... what’s this?
There’s faint INTEREST on a few of these faces. The blue
meth talk hits some of these folks where they live.

Jesse notes his potential customers with lazy satisfaction.
Rehab saved his life -- yet now he’s here to sell meth to
people struggling with addiction. Awful. Has Jesse truly
become the “bad guy,” like he once told us? Off him...
INT. HOSPITAL - HANK’S ROOM - DAY
Hank sleeps, deathly pale. His jagged breathing and the hum
of monitors are our only sounds. ADJUST to reveal...
... Walt standing alone in b.g., watching his brother-inlaw’s troubled sleep with haunted eyes. Walt’s been here for
the better part of an hour, tormented by the knowledge that
he’s responsible for Hank being in this bed.
We linger on this sad tableau. Now Marie’s voice PRELAPS:
MARIE (V.O.)
I swear to God, I’ll do it. I will
go to the press.
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY
As Marie sits venting, Walt listens with concern. He may be
weighed down by guilt and the impossibility of his situation,
but right now he’s truly just a worried brother-in-law.
Skyler sits at Marie’s side, preoccupied. She leafs through
a sheaf of Marie’s hospital paperwork -- the latest insurance
outrage, apparently (it’s what currently upsets Marie).
MARIE
I will go to 48 Hours, I will go to
Nightline -- I don’t know if there
is a Nightline anymore? It doesn’t
matter -- they will all take it and
they will run with it. Because
he’s a hero. And he’s not going to
be in a wheelchair at 43.
SKYLER
Jesus.
WALT
I’m sorry, Marie -- I’m sure
Skyler’s already told you this --
but if there’s ever anything you
need... anything at all...
MARIE
It’s good to have you here. Both
of you.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 45.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
Marie shoots just a hint of a glance to Skyler. She knows
something’s up between Skyler and Ted. Marie doesn’t have
the bandwidth to get into a fight over it, but she believes
one thing: Walt belongs in the family.
WALT
I just wish there was something
more that we could do.
Marie smiles faintly, expecting nothing. Silence as they sit
here together. What more can one say at times like these?
Skyler studies Walt closely a moment. She’s been thinking
long and hard. Chewing something over. And now:
Skyler has been considering this problem for days, trying to
come up with another solution -- but no matter how she looks
at it, she only sees the one option. Therefore, taking the
risk of a lifetime...
SKYLER
Walt? We can always pay their
bills.
Walt blinks, confused. Marie frowns, breaking a smile and
lifting an eyebrow. It’s unlike her sister to talk nonsense.
MARIE
Please. It’s tens of thousands of
dollars --
SKYLER
-- We have the money. More than
enough.
(then)
Walt earned it.
Marie glances over at Walt, but he’s blank with confusion --
and PANIC. What is Skyler doing?!?
Suddenly Walt knows with terrible certainty where this is
headed -- Skyler is about to tell Marie everything. Walt
steps over to sit next to her, on her opposite side.
WALT
Skyler --
SKYLER
I think Marie should know the
truth.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 46.
CONTINUED:
(CONTINUED)
WALT
(a hand on her arm now)
Skyler, I really don’t think this
is a good idea. I-I think that --
SKYLER
(to Marie; coolly, simply)
He earned it gambling.
Gambling? Now Walt’s simply mystified. Marie glances from
one to the other -- hooked and wanting to hear more.
SKYLER
Walt and I, uh, we’ve had our
problems lately. You know that.
And, uh... what it came down to,
really, was money. Pure and
simple.
Skyler glances at Walt with... is that a touch of empathy?
SKYLER
When Walt was diagnosed -- it, um,
it changed him. Looking back, I
don’t think I ever really
understood what it was that he was
going through. It was more than
facing death. It was knowing that
he was going to leave behind...
nothing. And so that’s how this
all started. For better or worse,
he wanted to provide.
(then)
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.
Walt’s stunned: this is exactly how he would have explained
it himself. Marie can’t help asking the obvious question.
MARIE
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.
SKYLER
Yeah, thought so, too. The truth
is, he never took their money --
not a dime. He was too proud to
take what he considered to be
charity.
(to Walt)
Isn’t that right?
Walt manages a numb nod. However, Skyler isn’t coming down
hard on him here -- she’s simply telling a story.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 47.
CONTINUED: (2)
(CONTINUED)
In fact, she seems through with anger. Can she have really
made her peace with Walt? At the moment, it kinda looks like
it.
SKYLER
So, he put his mind to it, and
uh... well, you know how Walt is,
he’s-he’s a problem solver. And he
read books and he did a whole bunch
of research... and he came up with
this system.
MARIE
A system.
SKYLER
A system for counting cards in
Blackjack.
MARIE
(a frowning beat)
Wha-wha-whaddya mean? Like Rain
Man?
Walt doesn’t meet Marie’s questioning glance. Now he knows
Skyler isn’t going to reveal his meth business -- but where
can she be going with this?
SKYLER
Well... no... I don’t pretend to
understand, you know, all the
details, but he was convinced that
if he put enough money into it,
he’d have a, um... uh --
(to Walt)
God... What is it? A “statistical
edge?”
Walt takes a second to catch up with her. Barely audible:
WALT
Yes. Statistical... um.
SKYLER
So he, every spare minute, Walt was
at some card table somewhere. At
first he went to casinos, but then
he realized that...
VOICES approach nearby, a pair of NURSES. Skyler pauses.
When they’ve passed by, she continues, her voice lower. Walt
and Marie lean forward, they don’t want to miss a word.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 48.
CONTINUED: (3)
(CONTINUED)
SKYLER
...he realized that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.
And if it gets reported, your
family might find out, and if you
do not want your family to find
out... then you find another place
to gamble. Like an illegal,
backroom game. You remember all
those “long walks” that Walt used
to take? All that time he used
spend away from home?
(to Walt, ruefully)
I guess for a couple months there
you were sort of leading a double
life, weren’t you?
Walt just nods, eyes slowly lowering in shame.
For Marie all the pieces of the puzzle are falling into
place. This is what ruined Walt and Skyler’s marriage. This
is what Skyler hid from her for so long. And furthermore:
MARIE
Oh, my God.
(it can’t be!)
Oh my God, your-your-your “fugue
state?” Was that, some sort of
cover..?
The very mention of the fugue state seems to exhaust Skyler.
She continues in quiet tones of sadness, loss and -- could it
be? -- forgiveness.
SKYLER
-- No, no he did not fake that,
Marie. The night that Walt
disappeared? He lost fourteen
thousand dollars. It was his
pension fund, our savings.
Basically every last dime we had to
our name. Gone.
Marie stares open-mouthed at Walt -- whose own mind is
racing. He’s astounded by the complexity, the inventiveness
of Skyler’s lie. But he’s also trying to understand where
the lie ends and the truth begins.
SKYLER
He couldn’t live with it. He was
suicidal.
BREAKING BAD #309 "Kafkaesque" AS BROADCAST 49.
CONTINUED: (4)
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
But you have to understand -- that
as soon as he got out of the
hospital, he went right back to
gambling. I mean, that’s how deep
this went.
MARIE
How could you do that to her, Walt?
Marie says this quietly, accusingly... but of course Walt has
no answer for her. Right now Skyler is the one with all the
answers, and Walt is simply along for the ride.
SKYLER
Anyway. This system of his -- he
finally got it to work.
In the middle of this emotional roller coaster ride, Walt is
beginning to nurse a faint flicker of hope. After all,
Skyler’s proposing to use his drug money for the family --
and that’s a first step towards accepting what he’s done.
SKYLER
So all this is to say... we have
the money.
(a meaningful look to him)
No more gambling -- but we have the
money.
MARIE
(can’t help but ask)
How much money..?
SKYLER
Walt..?
WALT
Ah. Well, uh...
(considers; fuck it)
It’s in the seven figures.
MARIE
MARIE
Holy Mary, mother of God.
WALT
(off both girls’ surprise)
What can I say? I did very well.
And now Skyler gets back to the point of all this.

SKYLER (CONT'D)

SKYLER
Marie, you will take our money.
Use it to take care of Hank.
Marie is still trying to assimilate all that she’s heard.
It’s a gigantic shift in perception. Walt did this? Good
old reliable, cancer-saint Walt?
Hearing this story, she’s got every reason to be angry at
him... but hell, I guess he meant well, after all.
Sky looks to Walt. Taking her cue, he makes an earnest plea.
WALT
Please, Marie. Let us help.
Suddenly Walt and Skyler are working together towards a
common goal. How long has it been since we’ve seen that?
TIME CUT TO:
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY - LATER
Marie, Walt, and Skyler stand... moments later.
MARIE
Does Walter, Jr. know about this?
SKYLER
Absolutely not, and I need to keep
it that way.
(then)
And Hank, okay? Hank’s got enough
on his mind, right now. So, can we
just please keep this between us?
Walt can’t help but stare at Skyler with admiration: my God,
she’s thought of everything! Marie nods, agreeing with Sky.
MARIE
(overwhelmed)
Yeah. Yeah, I just -- I need to...
Skyler nods: it’s okay. Marie’s bound to have more
questions -- and Skyler will answer them all, in detail.
Whatever it takes to persuade Marie to accept the money.
SKYLER
Yeah, okay. We’ll talk about it
later.
Marie exits, leaving Walt and Skyler by themselves. It takes
him a moment to even form the words, but finally:

WALT
How... did you come up with that?
Whe-where... Where... did you
possibly..?
SKYLER
(staring at him; a beat)
I learned from the best.
She means Liar Walt, of course. Walt doesn’t quite know how
to take this. It doesn’t exactly sound like a compliment.
Skyler leans in close and lowers her voice.
SKYLER
Somehow, something tells me that
Hank is here because of you. And
I’m not forgetting that.
Damn right they’ll use the money for Hank’s recovery. As far
as Skyler’s concerned, that’s the only use for this blood
money. She pierces him with a knowing glance and follows
Marie without looking back.
Forgiveness and understanding are still distant hopes.
NEW ANGLE -- looking into the waiting room from up the hall.
Walt is framed in the doorway, watching Skyler disappear.
Quietly devastated.
