# Playing with Nano GPT

This repo is my attempt to experiment with a few aspects of GPT and getting hands on experience of all my theoretical learnings. I have used Karpthy's version of a nano GPT for this experimentation. You can find more info about the same here : https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT

I focused on the following tasks :

## Hyperparameter Experimentation

Modifying hyperparameters such as number of heads, layers in order to achieve a setting which produces the lowest validation loss.

## Evaluation Metrics

## My favourite Dataset

## Fine tuning
